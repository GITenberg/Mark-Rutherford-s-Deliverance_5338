<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>CHAPTER
I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NEWSPAPERS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I had established myself in my
new lodgings in Camden Town, I found I had ten pounds in my
pocket, and again there was no outlook.&nbsp; I examined
carefully every possibility.&nbsp; At last I remembered that a
relative of mine, who held some office in the House of Commons,
added to his income by writing descriptive accounts of the
debates, throwing in by way of supplement any stray scraps of
gossip which he was enabled to collect.&nbsp; The rules of the
House as to the admission of strangers were not so strict then as
they are now, and he assured me that if I could but secure a
commission from a newspaper, he could pass me into one of the
galleries, and, when there was nothing to be heard worth
describing, I could remain in the lobby, where I should by
degrees find many opportunities of picking up intelligence which
would pay.&nbsp; So far, so good; but how to obtain the
commission?&nbsp; I managed to get hold of a list of all the
country papers, and I wrote to nearly every one, offering my
services.&nbsp; I am afraid that I somewhat exaggerated them, for
I had two answers, and, after a little correspondence, two
engagements.&nbsp; This was an unexpected stroke of luck; but
alas! both journals circulated in the same district.&nbsp; I
never could get together more stuff than would fill about a
column and a half, and consequently I was obliged, with infinite
pains, to vary, so that it could not be recognised, the form of
what, at bottom, was essentially the same matter.&nbsp; This was
work which would have been disagreeable enough, if I had not now
ceased in a great measure to demand what was agreeable.&nbsp; In
years past I coveted a life, not of mere sensual
enjoyment&mdash;for that I never cared&mdash;but a life which
should be filled with activities of the noblest kind, and it was
intolerable to me to reflect that all my waking hours were in the
main passed in merest drudgery, and that only for a few moments
at the beginning or end of the day could it be said that the
higher sympathies were really operative.&nbsp; Existence to me
was nothing but these few moments, and consequently flitted like
a shadow.&nbsp; I was now, however, the better of what was half
disease and half something healthy and good.&nbsp; In the first
place, I had discovered that my appetite was far larger than my
powers.&nbsp; Consumed by a longing for continuous intercourse
with the best, I had no ability whatever to maintain it, and I
had accepted as a fact, however mysterious it might be, that the
human mind is created with the impulses of a seraph and the
strength of a man.&nbsp; Furthermore, what was I that I should
demand exceptional treatment?&nbsp; Thousands of men and women
superior to myself, are condemned, if that is the proper word to
use, to almost total absence from themselves.&nbsp; The roar of
the world for them is never lulled to rest, nor can silence ever
be secured in which the voice of the Divine can be heard.</p>
<p>My letters were written twice a week, and as each contained a
column and a half, I had six columns weekly to manufacture.&nbsp;
These I was in the habit of writing in the morning, my evenings
being spent at the House.&nbsp; At first I was rather interested,
but after a while the occupation became tedious beyond measure,
and for this reason.&nbsp; In a discussion of any importance
about fifty members perhaps would take part, and had made up
their minds beforehand to speak.&nbsp; There could not possibly
be more than three or four reasons for or against the motion, and
as the knowledge that what the intending orator had to urge had
been urged a dozen times before on that very night never deterred
him from urging it again, the same arguments, diluted, muddled,
and mispresented, recurred with the most wearisome iteration.</p>
<p>The public outside knew nothing or very little of the real
House of Commons, and the manner in which time was squandered
there, for the reports were all of them much abbreviated.&nbsp;
In fact, I doubt whether anybody but the Speaker, and one or two
other persons in the same position as myself, really felt with
proper intensity what the waste was, and how profound was the
vanity of members and the itch for expression; for even the
reporters were relieved at stated intervals, and the impression
on their minds was not continuous.&nbsp; Another evil result of
these attendances at the House was a kind of political
scepticism.&nbsp; Over and over again I have seen a Government
arraigned for its conduct of foreign affairs.&nbsp; The evidence
lay in masses of correspondence which it would have required some
days to master, and the verdict, after knowing the facts, ought
to have depended upon the application of principles, each of
which admitted a contrary principle for which much might be
pleaded.&nbsp; There were not fifty members in the House with the
leisure or the ability to understand what it was which had
actually happened, and if they had understood it, they would not
have had the wit to see what was the rule which ought to have
decided the case.&nbsp; Yet, whether they understood or not, they
were obliged to vote, and what was worse, the constituencies also
had to vote, and so the gravest matters were settled in utter
ignorance.&nbsp; This has often been adduced as an argument
against an extended suffrage, but, if it is an argument against
anything, it is an argument against intrusting the aristocracy
and even the House itself with the destinies of the nation; for
no dock labourer could possibly be more entirely empty of all
reasons for action than the noble lords, squires, lawyers, and
railway directors whom I have seen troop to the division
bell.&nbsp; There is something deeper than this scepticism, but
the scepticism is the easiest and the most obvious conclusion to
an open mind dealing so closely and practically with politics as
it was my lot to do at this time of my life.&nbsp; Men must be
governed, and when it comes to the question, by whom? I, for one,
would far sooner in the long run trust the people at large than I
would the few, who in everything which relates to Government are
as little instructed as the many and more difficult to
move.&nbsp; The very fickleness of the multitude, the theme of
such constant declamation, is so far good that it proves a
susceptibility to impressions to which men hedged round by
impregnable conventionalities cannot yield. <a

class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>When I was living in the country, the pure sky and the
landscape formed a large portion of my existence, so large that
much of myself depended on it, and I wondered how men could be
worth anything if they could never see the face of nature.&nbsp;
For this belief my early training on the &ldquo;Lyrical
Ballads&rdquo; is answerable.&nbsp; When I came to London the
same creed survived, and I was for ever thirsting for intercourse
with my ancient friend.&nbsp; Hope, faith, and God seemed
impossible amidst the smoke of the streets.&nbsp; It was now very
difficult for me, except at rare opportunities, to leave London,
and it was necessary for me, therefore, to understand that all
that was essential for me was obtainable there, even though I
should never see anything more than was to be seen in journeying
through the High Street, Camden Town, Tottenham Court Road, the
Seven Dials, and Whitehall.&nbsp; I should have been guilty of a
simple surrender to despair if I had not forced myself to make
this discovery.&nbsp; I cannot help saying, with all my love for
the literature of my own day, that it has an evil side to it
which none know except the millions of sensitive persons who are
condemned to exist in great towns.&nbsp; It might be imagined
from much of this literature that true humanity and a belief in
God are the offspring of the hills or the ocean; and by
implication, if not expressly, the vast multitudes who hardly
ever see the hills or the ocean must be without a religion.&nbsp;
The long poems which turn altogether upon scenery, perhaps in
foreign lands, and the passionate devotion to it which they
breathe, may perhaps do good in keeping alive in the hearts of
men a determination to preserve air, earth, and water from
pollution; but speaking from experience as a Londoner, I can
testify that they are most depressing, and I would counsel
everybody whose position is what mine was to avoid these books
and to associate with those which will help him in his own
circumstances.</p>
<p>Half of my occupation soon came to an end.&nbsp; One of my
editors sent me a petulant note telling me that all I wrote he
could easily find out himself, and that he required something
more &ldquo;graphic and personal.&rdquo;&nbsp; I could do no
better, or rather I ought to say, no worse than I had been
doing.&nbsp; These letters were a great trouble to me.&nbsp; I
was always conscious of writing so much of which I was not
certain, and so much which was indifferent to me.&nbsp; The
unfairness of parties haunted me.&nbsp; But I continued to write,
because I saw no other way of getting a living, and surely it is
a baser dishonesty to depend upon the charity of friends because
some pleasant, clean, ideal employment has not presented itself,
than to soil one&rsquo;s hands with a little of the inevitable
mud.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I ever felt anything more keenly
than I did a sneer from an acquaintance of mine who was in the
habit of borrowing money from me.&nbsp; He was a painter, whose
pictures were never sold because he never worked hard enough to
know how to draw, and it came to my ears indirectly that he had
said that &ldquo;he would rather live the life of a medieval
ascetic than condescend to the degradation of scribbling a dozen
columns weekly of utter trash on subjects with which he had no
concern.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that very moment he owed me five
pounds.&nbsp; God knows that I admitted my dozen columns to be
utter trash, but it ought to have been forgiven by those who saw
that I was struggling to save myself from the streets and to keep
a roof over my head.&nbsp; Degraded, however, as I might be, I
could not get down to the &ldquo;graphic and personal,&rdquo; for
it meant nothing less than the absolutely false.&nbsp; I
therefore contrived to exist on the one letter, which, excepting
the mechanical labour of writing a second, took up as much of my
time as if I had to write two.</p>
<p>Never, but once or twice at the most, did my labours meet with
the slightest recognition beyond payment.&nbsp; Once I remember
that I accused a member of a discreditable man&oelig;uvre to
consume the time of the House, and as he represented a borough in
my district, he wrote to the editor denying the charge.&nbsp; The
editor without any inquiry&mdash;and I believe I was
mistaken&mdash;instantly congratulated me on having
&ldquo;scored.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time, when Parliament was
not sitting, I ventured, by way of filling up my allotted space,
to say a word on behalf of a now utterly forgotten novel.&nbsp; I
had a letter from the authoress thanking me, but alas! the
illusion vanished.&nbsp; I was tempted by this one novel to look
into others which I found she had written, and I discovered that
they were altogether silly.&nbsp; The attraction of the one of
which I thought so highly, was due not to any real merit which it
possessed, but to something I had put into it.&nbsp; It was dead,
but it had served as a wall to re-echo my own voice.&nbsp;
Excepting these two occasions, I don&rsquo;t think that one
solitary human being ever applauded or condemned one solitary
word of which I was the author.&nbsp; All my friends knew where
my contributions were to be found, but I never heard that they
looked at them.&nbsp; They were never worth reading, and yet such
complete silence was rather lonely.&nbsp; The tradesman who makes
a good coat enjoys the satisfaction of having fitted and pleased
his customer, and a bricklayer, if he be diligent, is rewarded by
knowing that his master understands his value, but I never knew
what it was to receive a single response.&nbsp; I wrote for an
abstraction; and spoke to empty space.&nbsp; I cannot help
claiming some pity and even respect for the class to which I
belonged.&nbsp; I have heard them called all kinds of hard names,
hacks, drudges, and something even more contemptible, but the
injustice done to them is monstrous.&nbsp; Their wage is hardly
earned; it is peculiarly precarious, depending altogether upon
their health, and no matter how ill they may be they must
maintain the liveliness of manner which is necessary to procure
acceptance.&nbsp; I fell in with one poor fellow whose line was
something like my own.&nbsp; I became acquainted with him through
sitting side by side with him at the House.&nbsp; He lived in
lodgings in Goodge Street, and occasionally I walked with him as
far as the corner of Tottenham Court Road, where I caught the
last omnibus northward.&nbsp; He wrote like me a
&ldquo;descriptive article&rdquo; for the country, but he also
wrote every now and then&mdash;a dignity to which I never
attained&mdash;a &ldquo;special&rdquo; for London.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;descriptive articles&rdquo; were more political than mine,
and he was obliged to be violently Tory.&nbsp; His creed,
however, was such a pure piece of professionalism, that though I
was Radical, and was expected to be so, we never jarred, and
often, as we wandered homewards, we exchanged notes, and were
mutually useful, his observations appearing in my paper, and mine
in his, with proper modifications.&nbsp; How he used to roar in
the <i>Gazette</i> against the opposite party, and yet I never
heard anything from him myself but what was diffident and
tender.&nbsp; He had acquired, as an instrument necessary to him,
an extraordinarily extravagant style, and he laid about him with
a bludgeon, which inevitably descended on the heads of all
prominent persons if they happened not to be Conservative, no
matter what their virtues might be.&nbsp; One peculiarity,
however, I noted in him.&nbsp; Although he ought every now and
then, when the subject was uppermost, to have flamed out in the
<i>Gazette</i> on behalf of the Church, I never saw a word from
him on that subject.&nbsp; He drew the line at religion.&nbsp; He
did not mind acting his part in things secular, for his
performances were, I am sure, mostly histrionic, but there he
stopped.&nbsp; The unreality of his character was a husk
surrounding him, but it did not touch the core.&nbsp; It was as
if he had said to himself, &ldquo;Political controversy is
nothing to me, and, what is more, is so uncertain that it matters
little whether I say yes or no, nor indeed does it matter if I
say yes <i>and</i> no, and I must keep my wife and children from
the workhouse; but when it comes to the relationship of man to
God, it is a different matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; His altogether
outside vehemence and hypocrisy did in fact react upon him, and
so far from affecting harmfully what lay deeper, produced a more
complete sincerity and transparency extending even to the finest
verbal distinctions.&nbsp; Over and over again have I heard him
preach to his wife, almost with pathos, the duty of perfect
exactitude in speech in describing the commonest
occurrences.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, my dear, <i>is</i> that so?&rdquo;
was a perpetual remonstrance with him; and he always insisted
upon it that there is no training more necessary for children
than that of teaching them not merely to speak the truth in the
ordinary, vulgar sense of the term, but to speak it in a much
higher sense, by rigidly compelling, point by point, a
correspondence of the words with the fact external or
internal.&nbsp; He never would tolerate in his own children a
mere hackneyed, borrowed expression, but demanded exact
portraiture; and nothing vexed him more than to hear one of them
spoil and make worthless what he or she had seen, by reporting it
in some stale phrase which had been used by everybody.&nbsp; This
refusal to take the trouble to watch the presentment to the mind
of anything which had been placed before it, and to reproduce it
in its own lines and colours was, as he said, nothing but
falsehood, and he maintained that the principal reason why people
are so uninteresting is not that they have nothing to say.&nbsp;
It is rather that they will not face the labour of saying in
their own tongue what they have to say, but cover it up and
conceal it in commonplace, so that we get, not what they
themselves behold and what they think, but a hieroglyphic or
symbol invented as the representative of a certain class of
objects or emotions, and as inefficient to represent a particular
object or emotion as <i>x</i> or <i>y</i> to set forth the
relation of Hamlet to Ophelia.&nbsp; He would even exercise his
children in this art of the higher truthfulness, and would
purposely make them give him an account of something which he had
seen and they had seen, checking them the moment he saw a lapse
from originality.&nbsp; Such was the Tory correspondent of the
<i>Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>I ought to say, by way of apology for him, that in his day it
signified little or nothing whether Tory or Whig was in
power.&nbsp; Politics had not become what they will one day
become, a matter of life or death, dividing men with really
private love and hate.&nbsp; What a mockery controversy was in
the House!&nbsp; How often I have seen members, who were furious
at one another across the floor, quietly shaking hands outside,
and inviting one another to dinner!&nbsp; I have heard them say
that we ought to congratulate ourselves that parliamentary
differences do not in this country breed personal
animosities.&nbsp; To me this seemed anything but a subject of
congratulation.&nbsp; Men who are totally at variance ought not
to be friends, and if Radical and Tory are not totally, but
merely superficially at variance, so much the worse for their
Radicalism and Toryism.</p>
<p>It is possible, and even probable, that the public fury and
the subsequent amity were equally absurd.&nbsp; Most of us have
no real loves and no real hatreds.&nbsp; Blessed is love, less
blessed is hatred, but thrice accursed is that indifference which
is neither one nor the other, the muddy mess which men call
friendship.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Kay&mdash;for that was his name&mdash;lived, as I have
said, in Goodge Street, where he had unfurnished
apartments.&nbsp; I often spent part of the Sunday with him, and
I may forestall obvious criticism by saying that I do not pretend
for a moment to defend myself from inconsistency in denouncing
members of Parliament for their duplicity, M&rsquo;Kay and myself
being also guilty of something very much like it.&nbsp; But there
was this difference between us and our parliamentary friends,
that we always divested ourselves of all hypocrisy when we were
alone.&nbsp; We then dropped the stage costume which members
continued to wear in the streets and at the dinner-table, and in
which some of them even slept and said their prayers.</p>
<p>London Sundays to persons who are not attached to any
religious community, and have no money to spend, are rather
dreary.&nbsp; We tried several ways of getting through the
morning.&nbsp; If we heard that there was a preacher with a
reputation, we went to hear him.&nbsp; As a rule, however, we got
no good in that way.&nbsp; Once we came to a chapel where there
was a minister supposed to be one of the greatest orators of the
day.&nbsp; We had much difficulty in finding standing room.&nbsp;
Just as we entered we heard him say, &ldquo;My friends, I appeal
to those of you who are parents.&nbsp; You know that if you say
to a child &lsquo;go,&rsquo; he goeth, and if you say
&lsquo;come,&rsquo; he cometh.&nbsp; So the
Lord&rdquo;&mdash;&nbsp; But at this point M&rsquo;Kay, who had
children, nudged me to come out; and out we went.&nbsp; Why does
this little scene remain with me?&nbsp; I can hardly say, but
here it stands.&nbsp; It is remembered, not so much by reason of
the preacher as by reason of the apparent acquiescence and
admiration of the audience, who seemed to be perfectly willing to
take over an experience from their pastor&mdash;if indeed it was
really an experience&mdash;which was not their own.&nbsp; Our
usual haunts on Sunday were naturally the parks and Kensington
Gardens; but artificial limited enclosures are apt to become
wearisome after a time, and we longed for a little more freedom
if a little less trim.&nbsp; So we would stroll towards Hampstead
or Highgate, the only drawback to these regions being the
squalid, ragged, half town, half suburb, through which it was
necessary to pass.&nbsp; The skirts of London when the air is
filled with north-easterly soot, grit, and filth, are cheerless,
and the least cheerful part of the scene is the inability of the
vast wandering masses of people to find any way of amusing
themselves.&nbsp; At the corner of one of the fields in Kentish
Town, just about to be devoured, stood a public-house, and
opposite the door was generally encamped a man who sold nothing
but Brazil nuts.&nbsp; Swarms of people lazily wandered past him,
most of them waiting for the public-house to open.&nbsp; Brazil
nuts on a cold black Sunday morning are not exhilarating, but the
costermonger found many customers who bought his nuts, and ate
them, merely because they had nothing better to do.&nbsp; We went
two or three times to a freethinking hall, where we were
entertained with demonstrations of the immorality of the
patriarchs and Jewish heroes, and arguments to prove that the
personal existence of the devil was a myth, the audience breaking
out into uproarious laughter at comical delineations of Noah and
Jonah.&nbsp; One morning we found the place completely
packed.&nbsp; A &ldquo;celebrated Christian,&rdquo; as he was
described to us, having heard of the hall, had volunteered to
engage in debate on the claims of the Old Testament to Divine
authority.&nbsp; He turned out to be a preacher whom we knew
quite well.&nbsp; He was introduced by his freethinking
antagonist, who claimed for him a respectful hearing.&nbsp; The
preacher said that before beginning he should like to
&ldquo;engage in prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Accordingly he came to the
front of the platform, lifted up his eyes, told God why he was
there, and besought Him to bless the discussion in the conversion
&ldquo;of these poor wandering souls, who have said in their
hearts that there is no God, to a saving faith in Him and in the
blood of Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; I expected that some resentment
would be displayed when the wandering souls found themselves
treated like errant sheep, but to my surprise they listened with
perfect silence; and when he had said &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; there
were great clappings of hands, and cries of
&ldquo;Bravo.&rdquo;&nbsp; They evidently considered the prayer
merely as an elocutionary show-piece.&nbsp; The preacher was much
disconcerted, but he recovered himself, and began his sermon, for
it was nothing more.&nbsp; He enlarged on the fact that men of
the highest eminence had believed in the Old Testament.&nbsp;
Locke and Newton had believed in it, and did it not prove
arrogance in us to doubt when the &ldquo;gigantic intellect which
had swept the skies, and had announced the law which bound the
universe together was satisfied?&rdquo;&nbsp; The witness of the
Old Testament to the New was another argument, but his main
reliance was upon the prophecies.&nbsp; From Adam to Isaiah there
was a continuous prefigurement of Christ.&nbsp; Christ was the
point to which everything tended; and &ldquo;now, my
friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot sit down without
imploring you to turn your eyes on Him who never yet repelled the
sinner, to wash in that eternal Fountain ever open for the
remission of sins, and to flee from the wrath to come.&nbsp; I
believe the sacred symbol of the cross has not yet lost its
efficacy.&nbsp; For eighteen hundred years, whenever it has been
exhibited to the sons of men, it has been potent to reclaim and
save them.&nbsp; &lsquo;I, if I be lifted up,&rsquo; cried the
Great Sufferer, &lsquo;will draw all men unto Me,&rsquo; and He
has drawn not merely the poor and ignorant but the philosopher
and the sage.&nbsp; Oh, my brethren, think what will happen if
you reject Him.&nbsp; I forbear to paint your doom.&nbsp; And
think again, on the other hand, of the bliss which awaits you if
you receive Him, of the eternal companionship with the Most High
and with the spirits of just men made perfect.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
hearers again applauded vigorously, and none less so than their
appointed leader, who was to follow on the other side.&nbsp; He
was a little man with small eyes; his shaven face was dark with a
black beard lurking under the skin, and his nose was slightly
turned up.&nbsp; He was evidently a trained debater who had
practised under railway arches, discussion &ldquo;forums,&rdquo;
and in the classes promoted by his sect.&nbsp; He began by saying
that he could not compliment his friend who had just sat down on
the inducements which he had offered them to become
Christians.&nbsp; The New Cut was not a nice place on a wet day,
but he had rather sit at a stall there all day long with his feet
on a basket than lie in the bosom of some of the just men made
perfect portrayed in the Bible.&nbsp; Nor, being married, should
he feel particularly at ease if he had to leave his wife with
David.&nbsp; David certainly ought to have got beyond all that
kind of thing, considering it must be over 3000 years since he
first saw Bathsheba; but we are told that the saints are for ever
young in heaven, and this treacherous villain, who would have
been tried by a jury of twelve men and hung outside Newgate if he
had lived in the nineteenth century, might be dangerous
now.&nbsp; He was an amorous old gentleman up to the very
last.&nbsp; (Roars of laughter.)&nbsp; Nor did the speaker feel
particularly anxious to be shut up with all the bishops, who of
course are amongst the elect, and on their departure from this
vale of tears tempered by ten thousand a year, are duly supplied
with wings.&nbsp; Much more followed in the same strain upon the
immorality of the Bible heroes, their cruelty, and the cruelty of
the God who sanctioned it.&nbsp; Then followed a clever
exposition of the inconsistencies of the Old Testament history,
the impossibility of any reference to Jesus therein, and a really
earnest protest against the quibbling by which those who believed
in the Bible as a revelation sought to reconcile it with
science.&nbsp; &ldquo;Finally,&rdquo; said the speaker, &ldquo;I
am sure we all of us will pass a vote of thanks to our reverend
friend for coming to see us, and we cordially invite him to come
again.&nbsp; If I might be allowed to offer a suggestion, it
would be that he should make himself acquainted with our case
before he pays us another visit, and not suppose that we are to
be persuaded with the rhetoric which may do very well for the
young women of his congregation, but won&rsquo;t go down
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was fair and just, for the eminent
Christian was nothing but an ordinary minister, who, when he was
prepared for his profession, had never been allowed to see what
are the historical difficulties of Christianity, lest he should
be overcome by them.&nbsp; On the other hand, his sceptical
opponents were almost devoid of the faculty for appreciating the
great remains of antiquity, and would probably have considered
the machinery of the Prometheus Bound or of the Iliad a
sufficient reason for a sneer.&nbsp; That they should spend their
time in picking the Bible to pieces when there was so much
positive work for them to do, seemed to me as melancholy as if
they had spent themselves upon theology.&nbsp; To waste a Sunday
morning in ridiculing such stories as that of Jonah was surely as
imbecile as to waste it in proving their verbal veracity.</p>

23</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">M&rsquo;KAY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was foggy and overcast as we
walked home to Goodge Street.&nbsp; The churches and chapels were
emptying themselves, but the great mass of the population had
been &ldquo;nowhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had dinner with M&rsquo;Kay,
and as the day wore on the fog thickened.&nbsp; London on a dark
Sunday afternoon, more especially about Goodge Street, is
depressing.&nbsp; The inhabitants drag themselves hither and
thither in languor and uncertainty.&nbsp; Small mobs loiter at
the doors of the gin palaces.&nbsp; Costermongers wander
aimlessly, calling &ldquo;walnuts&rdquo; with a cry so melancholy
that it sounds as the wail of the hopelessly lost may be imagined
to sound when their anguish has been deadened by the monotony of
a million years.</p>
<p>About two or three o&rsquo;clock decent working men in their
best clothes emerge from the houses in such streets as Nassau
Street.&nbsp; It is part of their duty to go out after dinner on
Sunday with the wife and children.&nbsp; The husband pushes the
perambulator out of the dingy passage, and gazes doubtfully this
way and that way, not knowing whither to go, and evidently
longing for the Monday, when his work, however disagreeable it
may be, will be his plain duty.&nbsp; The wife follows carrying a
child, and a boy and girl in unaccustomed apparel walk by her
side.&nbsp; They come out into Mortimer Street.&nbsp; There are
no shops open; the sky over their heads is mud, the earth is mud
under their feet, the muddy houses stretch in long rows, black,
gaunt, uniform.&nbsp; The little party reach Hyde Park, also
wrapped in impenetrable mud-grey.&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s face
brightens for a moment as he says, &ldquo;It is time to go
back,&rdquo; and so they return, without the interchange of a
word, unless perhaps they happen to see an omnibus horse fall
down on the greasy stones.&nbsp; What is there worth thought or
speech on such an expedition?&nbsp; Nothing!&nbsp; The tradesman
who kept the oil and colour establishment opposite to us was not
to be tempted outside.&nbsp; It was a little more comfortable
than Nassau Street, and, moreover, he was religious and did not
encourage Sabbath-breaking.&nbsp; He and his family always moved
after their mid-day Sabbath repast from the little back room
behind the shop up to what they called the drawing-room
overhead.&nbsp; It was impossible to avoid seeing them every time
we went to the window.&nbsp; The father of the family, after his
heavy meal, invariably sat in the easy-chair with a handkerchief
over his eyes and slept.&nbsp; The children were always at the
windows, pretending to read books, but in reality watching the
people below.&nbsp; At about four o&rsquo;clock their papa
generally awoke, and demanded a succession of hymn tunes played
on the piano.&nbsp; When the weather permitted, the lower sash
was opened a little, and the neighbours were indulged with the
performance of &ldquo;Vital Spark,&rdquo; the father
&ldquo;coming in&rdquo; now and then with a bass note or two at
the end where he was tolerably certain of the harmony.&nbsp; At
five o&rsquo;clock a prophecy of the incoming tea brought us some
relief from the contemplation of the landscape or
brick-scape.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;some relief,&rdquo; for meals at
M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s were a little disagreeable.&nbsp; His wife
was an honest, good little woman, but so much attached to him and
so dependent on him that she was his mere echo.&nbsp; She had no
opinions which were not his, and whenever he said anything which
went beyond the ordinary affairs of the house, she listened with
curious effort, and generally responded by a weakened repetition
of M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s own observations.&nbsp; He perpetually,
therefore, had before him an enfeebled reflection of himself, and
this much irritated him, notwithstanding his love for her; for
who could help loving a woman who, without the least hesitation,
would have opened her veins at his command, and have given up
every drop of blood in her body for him?&nbsp; Over and over
again I have heard him offer some criticism on a person or event,
and the customary chime of approval would ensue, provoking him to
such a degree that he would instantly contradict himself with
much bitterness, leaving poor Mrs. M&rsquo;Kay in much
perplexity.&nbsp; Such a shot as this generally reduced her to
timid silence.&nbsp; As a rule, he always discouraged any topic
at his house which was likely to serve as an occasion for showing
his wife&rsquo;s dependence on him.&nbsp; He designedly talked
about her household affairs, asked her whether she had mended his
clothes and ordered the coals.&nbsp; She knew that these things
were not what was upon his mind, and she answered him in
despairing tones, which showed how much she felt the obtrusive
condescension to her level.&nbsp; I greatly pitied her, and
sometimes, in fact, my emotion at the sight of her struggles with
her limitations almost overcame me and I was obliged to get up
and go.&nbsp; She was childishly affectionate.&nbsp; If
M&rsquo;Kay came in and happened to go up to her and kiss her,
her face brightened into the sweetest and happiest smile.&nbsp; I
recollect once after he had been unusually annoyed with her he
repented just as he was leaving home, and put his lips to her
head, holding it in both his hands.&nbsp; I saw her gently take
the hand from her forehead and press it to her mouth, the tears
falling down her cheek meanwhile.&nbsp; Nothing would ever tempt
her to admit anything against her husband.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Kay was
violent and unjust at times.&nbsp; His occupation he hated, and
his restless repugnance to it frequently discharged itself
indifferently upon everything which came in his way.&nbsp; His
children often thought him almost barbarous, but in truth he did
not actually see them when he was in one of these moods.&nbsp;
What was really present with him, excluding everything else, was
the sting of something more than usually repulsive of which they
knew nothing.&nbsp; Mrs. M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s answer to her
children&rsquo;s remonstrances when they were alone with her
always was, &ldquo;He is so worried,&rdquo; and she invariably
dwelt upon their faults which had given him the opportunity for
his wrath.</p>
<p>I think M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s treatment of her wholly
wrong.&nbsp; I think that he ought not to have imposed himself
upon her so imperiously.&nbsp; I think he ought to have striven
to ascertain what lay concealed in that modest heart, to have
encouraged its expression and development, to have debased
himself before her that she might receive courage to rise, and he
would have found that she had something which he had not; not
<i>his</i> something perhaps, but something which would have made
his life happier.&nbsp; As it was, he stood upon his own ground
above her.&nbsp; If she could reach him, well and good, if not,
the helping hand was not proffered, and she fell back,
hopeless.&nbsp; Later on he discovered his mistake.&nbsp; She
became ill very gradually, and M&rsquo;Kay began to see in the
distance a prospect of losing her.&nbsp; A frightful pit came in
view.&nbsp; He became aware that he could not do without
her.&nbsp; He imagined what his home would have been with other
women whom he knew, and he confessed that with them he would have
been less contented.&nbsp; He acknowledged that he had been
guilty of a kind of criminal epicurism; that he rejected in
foolish, fatal, nay, even wicked indifference, the bread of life
upon which he might have lived and thriven.&nbsp; His whole
effort now was to suppress himself in his wife.&nbsp; He read to
her, a thing he never did before, and when she misunderstood, he
patiently explained; he took her into his counsels and asked her
opinion; he abandoned his own opinion for hers, and in the
presence of her children he always deferred to her, and delighted
to acknowledge that she knew more than he did, that she was right
and he was wrong.&nbsp; She was now confined to her house, and
the end was near, but this was the most blessed time of her
married life.&nbsp; She grew under the soft rain of his loving
care, and opened out, not, indeed, into an oriental flower, rich
in profound mystery of scent and colour, but into a blossom of
the chalk-down.&nbsp; Altogether concealed and closed she would
have remained if it had not been for this beneficent and heavenly
gift poured upon her.&nbsp; He had just time enough to see what
she really was, and then she died.&nbsp; There are some natures
that cannot unfold under pressure or in the presence of
unregarding power.&nbsp; Hers was one.&nbsp; They require a clear
space round them, the removal of everything which may overmaster
them, and constant delicate attention.&nbsp; They require too a
recognition of the fact, which M&rsquo;Kay for a long time did
not recognise, that it is folly to force them and to demand of
them that they shall be what they cannot be.&nbsp; I stood by the
grave this morning of my poor, pale, clinging little friend now
for some years at peace, and I thought that the tragedy of
Promethean torture or Christ-like crucifixion may indeed be
tremendous, but there is a tragedy too in the existence of a soul
like hers, conscious of its feebleness and ever striving to
overpass it, ever aware that it is an obstacle to the return of
the affection of the man whom she loves.</p>
<p>Meals, as I have said, were disagreeable at
M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s, and when we wanted to talk we went out of
doors.&nbsp; The evening after our visit to the debating hall we
moved towards Portland Place, and walked up and down there for an
hour or more.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Kay had a passionate desire to reform
the world.&nbsp; The spectacle of the misery of London, and of
the distracted swaying hither and thither of the multitudes who
inhabit it, tormented him incessantly.&nbsp; He always chafed at
it, and he never seemed sure that he had a right to the enjoyment
of the simplest pleasures so long as London was before him.&nbsp;
What a farce, he would cry, is all this poetry, philosophy, art,
and culture, when millions of wretched mortals are doomed to the
eternal darkness and crime of the city!&nbsp; Here are the
educated classes occupying themselves with exquisite emotions,
with speculations upon the Infinite, with addresses to flowers,
with the worship of waterfalls and flying clouds, and with the
incessant portraiture of a thousand moods and variations of love,
while their neighbours lie grovelling in the mire, and never know
anything more of life or its duties than is afforded them by a
police report in a bit of newspaper picked out of the
kennel.&nbsp; We went one evening to hear a great violin-player,
who played such music, and so exquisitely, that the limits of
life were removed.&nbsp; But we had to walk up the Haymarket
home, between eleven and twelve o&rsquo;clock, and the
violin-playing became the merest trifling.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Kay had
been brought up upon the Bible.&nbsp; He had before him, not only
there, but in the history of all great religious movements, a
record of the improvement of the human race, or of large portions
of it, not merely by gradual civilisation, but by inspiration
spreading itself suddenly.&nbsp; He could not get it out of his
head that something of this kind is possible again in our
time.&nbsp; He longed to try for himself in his own poor way in
one of the slums about Drury Lane.&nbsp; I sympathised with him,
but I asked him what he had to say.&nbsp; I remember telling him
that I had been into St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, and that I
pictured to myself the cathedral full, and myself in the
pulpit.&nbsp; I was excited while imagining the opportunity
offered me of delivering some message to three or four thousand
persons in such a building, but in a minute or two I discovered
that my sermon would be very nearly as follows: &ldquo;Dear
friends, I know no more than you know; we had better go
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; I admitted to him that if he could believe in
hell-fire, or if he could proclaim the Second Advent, as Paul did
to the Thessalonians, and get people to believe, he might change
their manners, but otherwise he could do nothing but resort to a
much slower process.&nbsp; With the departure of a belief in the
supernatural departs once and for ever the chance of regenerating
the race except by the school and by science. <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; However, M&rsquo;Kay thought he
would try.&nbsp; His earnestness was rather a hindrance than a
help to him, for it prevented his putting certain important
questions to himself, or at any rate it prevented his waiting for
distinct answers.&nbsp; He recurred to the apostles and Bunyan,
and was convinced that it was possible even now to touch depraved
men and women with an idea which should recast their lives.&nbsp;
So it is that the main obstacle to our success is a success which
has preceded us.&nbsp; We instinctively follow the antecedent
form, and consequently we either pass by, or deny altogether, the
life of our own time, because its expression has changed.&nbsp;
We never do practically believe that the Messiah is not
incarnated twice in the same flesh.&nbsp; He came as Jesus, and
we look for Him as Jesus now, overlooking the manifestation of
to-day, and dying, perhaps, without recognising it.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Kay had found a room near Parker Street, Drury Lane,
in which he proposed to begin, and that night, as we trod the
pavement of Portland Place, he propounded his plans to me, I
listening without much confidence, but loth nevertheless to take
the office of Time upon myself, and to disprove what experience
would disprove more effectually.&nbsp; His object was nothing
less than gradually to attract Drury Lane to come and be
saved.</p>
<p>The first Sunday I went with him to the room.&nbsp; As we
walked over the Drury Lane gratings of the cellars a most foul
stench came up, and one in particular I remember to this
day.&nbsp; A man half dressed pushed open a broken window beneath
us, just as we passed by, and there issued such a blast of
corruption, made up of gases bred by filth, air breathed and
rebreathed a hundred times, charged with odours of unnameable
personal uncleanness and disease, that I staggered to the gutter
with a qualm which I could scarcely conquer.&nbsp; At the doors
of the houses stood grimy women with their arms folded and their
hair disordered.&nbsp; Grimier boys and girls had tied a rope to
broken railings, and were swinging on it.&nbsp; The common door
to a score of lodgings stood ever open, and the children swarmed
up and down the stairs carrying with them patches of mud every
time they came in from the street.&nbsp; The wholesome practice
which amongst the decent poor marks off at least one day in the
week as a day on which there is to be a change; when there is to
be some attempt to procure order and cleanliness; a day to be
preceded by soap and water, by shaving, and by as many clean
clothes as can be procured, was unknown here.&nbsp; There was no
break in the uniformity of squalor; nor was it even possible for
any single family to emerge amidst such altogether suppressive
surroundings.&nbsp; All self-respect, all effort to do anything
more than to satisfy somehow the grossest wants, had
departed.&nbsp; The shops were open; most of them exhibiting a
most miscellaneous collection of goods, such as bacon cut in
slices, fire-wood, a few loaves of bread, and sweetmeats in dirty
bottles.&nbsp; Fowls, strange to say, black as the flagstones,
walked in and out of these shops, or descended into the dark
areas.&nbsp; The undertaker had not put up his shutters.&nbsp; He
had drawn down a yellow blind, on which was painted a picture of
a suburban cemetery.&nbsp; Two funerals, the loftiest effort of
his craft, were depicted approaching the gates.&nbsp; When the
gas was alight behind the blind, an effect was produced which was
doubtless much admired.&nbsp; He also displayed in his window a
model coffin, a work of art.&nbsp; It was about a foot long,
varnished, studded with little brass nails, and on the lid was
fastened a rustic cross stretching from end to end.&nbsp; The
desire to decorate existence in some way or other with more or
less care is nearly universal.&nbsp; The most sensual and the
meanest almost always manifest an indisposition to be content
with mere material satisfaction.&nbsp; I have known selfish,
gluttonous, drunken men spend their leisure moments in trimming a
bed of scarlet geraniums, and the vulgarest and most commonplace
of mortals considers it a necessity to put a picture in the room
or an ornament on the mantelpiece.&nbsp; The instinct, even in
its lowest forms, is divine.&nbsp; It is the commentary on the
text that man shall not live by bread alone.&nbsp; It is evidence
of an acknowledged compulsion&mdash;of which art is the highest
manifestation&mdash;to <i>escape</i>.&nbsp; In the alleys behind
Drury Lane this instinct, the very salt of life, was dead,
crushed out utterly, a symptom which seemed to me ominous, and
even awful to the last degree.&nbsp; The only house in which it
survived was in that of the undertaker, who displayed the
willows, the black horses, and the coffin.&nbsp; These may have
been nothing more than an advertisement, but from the care with
which the cross was elaborated, and the neatness with which it
was made to resemble a natural piece of wood, I am inclined to
believe that the man felt some pleasure in his work for its own
sake, and that he was not utterly submerged.&nbsp; The cross in
such dens as these, or, worse than dens, in such sewers!&nbsp; If
it be anything, it is a symbol of victory, of power to triumph
over resistance, and even death.&nbsp; Here was nothing but
sullen subjugation, the most grovelling slavery, mitigated only
by a tendency to mutiny.&nbsp; Here was a strength of
circumstance to quell and dominate which neither Jesus nor Paul
could have overcome&mdash;worse a thousandfold than Scribes or
Pharisees, or any form of persecution.&nbsp; The preaching of
Jesus would have been powerless here; in fact, no known stimulus,
nothing ever held up before men to stir the soul to activity, can
do anything in the back streets of great cities so long as they
are the cesspools which they are now.</p>
<p>We came to the room.&nbsp; About a score of
M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s own friends were there, and perhaps
half-a-dozen outsiders, attracted by the notice which had been
pasted on a board at the entrance.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Kay announced
his errand.&nbsp; The ignorance and misery of London he said were
intolerable to him.&nbsp; He could not take any pleasure in life
when he thought upon them.&nbsp; What could he do? that was the
question.&nbsp; He was not a man of wealth.&nbsp; He could not
buy up these hovels.&nbsp; He could not force an entrance into
them and persuade their inhabitants to improve themselves.&nbsp;
He had no talents wherewith to found a great organisation or
create public opinion.&nbsp; He had determined, after much
thought, to do what he was now doing.&nbsp; It was very little,
but it was all he could undertake.&nbsp; He proposed to keep this
room open as a place to which those who wished might resort at
different times, and find some quietude, instruction, and what
fortifying thoughts he could collect to enable men to endure
their almost unendurable sufferings.&nbsp; He did not intend to
teach theology.&nbsp; Anything which would be serviceable he
would set forth, but in the main he intended to rely on holding
up the examples of those who were greater than ourselves and were
our redeemers.&nbsp; He meant to teach Christ in the proper sense
of the word.&nbsp; Christ now is admired probably more than He
had ever been.&nbsp; Everybody agrees to admire Him, but where
are the people who really do what He did?&nbsp; There is no
religion now-a-days.&nbsp; Religion is a mere literature.&nbsp;
Cultivated persons sit in their studies and write overflowingly
about Jesus, or meet at parties and talk about Him; but He is not
of much use to me unless I say to myself, <i>how is it with
thee</i>? unless I myself become what He was.&nbsp; This was the
meaning of Jesus to the Apostle Paul.&nbsp; Jesus was in him; he
had put on Jesus; that is to say, Jesus lived in him like a
second soul, taking the place of his own soul and directing him
accordingly.&nbsp; That was religion, and it is absurd to say
that the English nation at this moment, or any section of it, is
religious.&nbsp; Its educated classes are inhabited by a hundred
minds.&nbsp; We are in a state of anarchy, each of us with a
different aim and shaping himself according to a different type;
while the uneducated classes are entirely given over to the
&ldquo;natural man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was firmly persuaded that we
need religion, poor and rich alike.&nbsp; We need some
controlling influence to bind together our scattered
energies.&nbsp; We do not know what we are doing.&nbsp; We read
one book one day and another book another day, but it is idle
wandering to right and left; it is not advancing on a straight
road.&nbsp; It is not possible to bind ourselves down to a
certain defined course, but still it is an enormous, an
incalculable advantage for us to have some irreversible standard
set up in us by which everything we meet is to be judged.&nbsp;
That is the meaning of the prophecy&mdash;whether it will ever be
fulfilled God only knows&mdash;that Christ shall judge the
world.&nbsp; All religions have been this.&nbsp; They have said
that in the midst of the infinitely possible&mdash;infinitely
possible evil and infinitely possible good too&mdash;we become
distracted.&nbsp; A thousand forces good and bad act upon
us.&nbsp; It is necessary, if we are to be men, if we are to be
saved, that we should be rescued from this tumult, and that our
feet should be planted upon a path.&nbsp; His object, therefore,
would be to preach Christ, as before said, and to introduce into
human life His unifying influence.&nbsp; He would try and get
them to see things with the eyes of Christ, to love with His
love, to judge with His judgment.&nbsp; He believed Christ was
fitted to occupy this place.&nbsp; He deliberately chose Christ
as worthy to be our central, shaping force.&nbsp; He would try by
degrees to prove this; to prove that Christ&rsquo;s way of
dealing with life is the best way, and so to create a genuinely
Christian spirit, which, when any choice of conduct is presented
to us, will prompt us to ask first of all, <i>how would Christ
have it</i>? or, when men and things pass before us, will decide
through him what we have to say about them.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Kay
added that he hoped his efforts would not be confined to
talking.&nbsp; He trusted to be able, by means of this little
meeting, gradually to gain admittance for himself and his friends
into the houses of the poor and do some practical good.&nbsp; At
present he had no organisation and no plans.&nbsp; He did not
believe in organisation and plans preceding a clear conception of
what was to be accomplished.&nbsp; Such, as nearly as I can now
recollect, is an outline of his discourse.&nbsp; It was
thoroughly characteristic of him.&nbsp; He always talked in this
fashion.&nbsp; He was for ever insisting on the aimlessness of
modern life, on the powerlessness of its vague activities to
mould men into anything good, to restrain them from evil or
moderate their passions, and he was possessed by a vision of a
new Christianity which was to take the place of the old and dead
theologies.&nbsp; I have reported him in my own language.&nbsp;
He strove as much as he could to make his meaning plain to
everybody.&nbsp; Just before he finished, three or four out of
the half-a-dozen outsiders who were present whistled with all
their might and ran down the stairs shouting to one
another.&nbsp; As we went out they had collected about the door,
and amused themselves by pushing one another against us, and
kicking an old kettle behind us and amongst us all the way up the
street, so that we were covered with splashes.&nbsp; Mrs.
M&rsquo;Kay went with us, and when we reached home, she tried to
say something about what she had heard.&nbsp; The cloud came over
her husband&rsquo;s face at once; he remained silent for a
minute, and getting up and going to the window, observed that it
ought to be cleaned, and that he could hardly see the opposite
house.&nbsp; The poor woman looked distressed, and I was just
about to come to her rescue by continuing what she had been
saying, when she rose, not in anger, but in trouble, and went
upstairs.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MISS LEROY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the great French war there
were many French prisoners in my native town.&nbsp; They led a
strange isolated life, for they knew nothing of our language,
nor, in those days, did three people in the town understand
theirs.&nbsp; The common soldiers amused themselves by making
little trifles and selling them.&nbsp; I have now before me a box
of coloured straw with the date 1799 on the bottom, which was
bought by my grandfather.&nbsp; One of these prisoners was an
officer named Leroy.&nbsp; Why he did not go back to France I
never heard, but I know that before I was born he was living near
our house on a small income; that he tried to teach French, and
that he had as his companion a handsome daughter who grew up
speaking English.&nbsp; What she was like when she was young I
cannot say, but I have had her described to me over and over
again.&nbsp; She had rather darkish brown hair, and she was tall
and straight as an arrow.&nbsp; This she was, by the way, even
into old age.&nbsp; She surprised, shocked, and attracted all the
sober persons in our circle.&nbsp; Her ways were not their
ways.&nbsp; She would walk out by herself on a starry night
without a single companion, and cause thereby infinite talk,
which would have converged to a single focus if it had not
happened that she was also in the habit of walking out at four
o&rsquo;clock on a summer&rsquo;s morning, and that in the church
porch of a little village not far from us, which was her
favourite resting-place, a copy of the <i>De Imitatione
Christi</i> was found which belonged to her.&nbsp; So the talk
was scattered again and its convergence prevented.&nbsp; She used
to say doubtful things about love.&nbsp; One of them struck my
mother with horror.&nbsp; Miss Leroy told a male person once, and
told him to his face, that if she loved him and he loved her, and
they agreed to sign one another&rsquo;s foreheads with a cross as
a ceremony, it would be as good to her as marriage.&nbsp; This
may seem a trifle, but nobody now can imagine what was thought of
it at the time it was spoken.&nbsp; My mother repeated it every
now and then for fifty years.&nbsp; It may be conjectured how
easily any other girls of our acquaintance would have been
classified, and justly classified, if they had uttered such
barefaced Continental immorality.&nbsp; Miss Leroy&rsquo;s
neighbours were remarkably apt at classifying their
fellow-creatures.&nbsp; They had a few, a very few holes, into
which they dropped their neighbours, and they must go into one or
the other.&nbsp; Nothing was more distressing than a specimen
which, notwithstanding all the violence which might be used to
it, would not fit into a hole, but remained an exception.&nbsp;
Some lout, I believe, reckoning on the legitimacy of his
generalisation, and having heard of this and other observations
accredited to Miss Leroy, ventured to be slightly rude to
her.&nbsp; What she said to him was never known, but he was
always shy afterwards of mentioning her name, and when he did he
was wont to declare that she was &ldquo;a rum un.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She was not particular, I have heard, about personal tidiness,
and this I can well believe, for she was certainly not
distinguished when I knew her for this virtue.&nbsp; She cared
nothing for the linen-closet, the spotless bed-hangings, and the
bright poker, which were the true household gods of the
respectable women of those days.&nbsp; She would have been
instantly set down as &ldquo;slut,&rdquo; and as having
&ldquo;nasty dirty forrin ways,&rdquo; if a peculiar habit of
hers had not unfortunately presented itself, most irritating to
her critics, so anxious promptly to gratify their philosophic
tendency towards scientific grouping.&nbsp; Mrs. Mobbs, who lived
next door to her, averred that she always slept with the window
open.&nbsp; Mrs. Mobbs, like everybody else, never opened her
window except to &ldquo;air the room.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs.
Mobbs&rsquo; best bedroom was carpeted all over, and contained a
great four-post bedstead, hung round with heavy hangings, and
protected at the top from draughts by a kind of firmament of
white dimity.&nbsp; Mrs. Mobbs stuffed a sack of straw up the
chimney of the fireplace, to prevent the fall of the
&ldquo;sutt,&rdquo; as she called it.&nbsp; Mrs. Mobbs, if she
had a visitor, gave her a hot supper, and expected her
immediately afterwards to go upstairs, draw the window curtains,
get into this bed, draw the bed curtains also, and wake up the
next morning &ldquo;bilious.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the proper
thing to do.&nbsp; Miss Leroy&rsquo;s sitting-room was decidedly
disorderly; the chairs were dusty; &ldquo;yer might write yer
name on the table,&rdquo; Mrs. Mobbs declared; but, nevertheless,
the casement was never closed night nor day; and, moreover, Miss
Leroy was believed by the strongest circumstantial evidence to
wash herself all over every morning, a habit which Mrs. Mobbs
thought &ldquo;weakening,&rdquo; and somehow connected with
ethical impropriety.&nbsp; When Miss Leroy was married, and first
as an elderly woman became known to me, she was very
inconsequential in her opinions, or at least appeared so to our
eyes.&nbsp; She must have been much more so when she was
younger.&nbsp; In our town we were all formed upon recognised
patterns, and those who possessed any one mark of the pattern,
had all.&nbsp; The wine-merchant, for example, who went to
church, eminently respectable, Tory, by no means associating with
the tradesfolk who displayed their goods in the windows, knowing
no &ldquo;experience,&rdquo; and who had never felt the
outpouring of the Spirit, was a specimen of a class like
him.&nbsp; Another class was represented by the dissenting
ironmonger, deacon, presiding at prayer-meetings, strict
Sabbatarian, and believer in eternal punishments; while a third
was set forth by &ldquo;Guffy,&rdquo; whose real name was
unknown, who got drunk, unloaded barges, assisted at the
municipal elections, and was never once seen inside a place of
worship.&nbsp; These patterns had existed amongst us from the
dimmest antiquity, and were accepted as part of the eternal order
of things; so much so, that the deacon, although he professed to
be sure that nobody who had not been converted would escape the
fire&mdash;and the wine-merchant certainly had not been
converted&mdash;was very far from admitting to himself that the
wine-merchant ought to be converted, or that it would be proper
to try and convert him.&nbsp; I doubt, indeed, whether our
congregation would have been happy, or would have thought any the
better of him, if he had left the church.&nbsp; Such an event,
however, could no more come within the reach of our vision than a
reversal of the current of our river.&nbsp; It would have broken
up our foundations and party-walls, and would have been
considered as ominous, and anything but a subject for
thankfulness.&nbsp; But Miss Leroy was not the wine-merchant, nor
the ironmonger, nor Guffy, and even now I cannot trace the hidden
centre of union from which sprang so much that was apparently
irreconcilable.&nbsp; She was a person whom nobody could have
created in writing a novel, because she was so
inconsistent.&nbsp; As I have said before, she studied Thomas
&agrave; Kempis, and her little French Bible was brown with
constant use.&nbsp; But then she read much fiction in which there
were scenes which would have made our hair stand on end.&nbsp;
The only thing she constantly abhorred in books was what was dull
and opaque.&nbsp; Yet, as we shall see presently, her dislike to
dulness, once at least in her life, notably failed her.&nbsp; She
was not Catholic, and professed herself Protestant, but such a
Protestantism!&nbsp; She had no sceptical doubts.&nbsp; She
believed implicitly that the Bible was the Word of God, and that
everything in it was true, but her interpretation of it was of
the strangest kind.&nbsp; Almost all our great doctrines seemed
shrunk to nothing in her eyes, while others, which were nothing
to us, were all-important to her.&nbsp; The atonement, for
instance, I never heard her mention, but Unitarianism was hateful
to her, and Jesus was her God in every sense of the word.&nbsp;
On the other hand, she was partly Pagan, for she knew very little
of that consideration for the feeble, and even for the foolish,
which is the glory of Christianity.&nbsp; She was rude to foolish
people, and she instinctively kept out of the way of all disease
and weakness, so that in this respect she was far below the
commonplace tradesman&rsquo;s wife, who visited the sick, sat up
with them, and, in fact, never seemed so completely in her
element as when she could be with anybody who was ill in bed.</p>
<p>Miss Leroy&rsquo;s father was republican, and so was my
grandfather.&nbsp; My grandfather and old Leroy were the only
people in our town who refused to illuminate when a victory was
gained over the French.&nbsp; Leroy&rsquo;s windows were spared
on the ground that he was not a Briton, but the mob endeavoured
to show my grandfather the folly of his belief in democracy by
smashing every pane of glass in front of his house with
stones.&nbsp; This drew him and Leroy together, and the result
was, that although Leroy himself never set foot inside any chapel
or church, Miss Leroy was often induced to attend our
meeting-house in company with a maiden aunt of mine, who rather
&ldquo;took to her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now comes the for ever
mysterious passage in history.&nbsp; There was amongst the
attendants at that meeting-house a young man who was apprentice
to a miller.&nbsp; He was a big, soft, quiet, plump-faced,
awkward youth, very good, but nothing more.&nbsp; He wore on
Sunday a complete suit of light pepper-and-salt clothes, and
continued to wear pepper-and-salt on Sunday all his life.&nbsp;
He taught in the Sunday-school, and afterwards, as he got older,
he was encouraged to open his lips at a prayer-meeting, and to
&ldquo;take the service&rdquo; in the village chapels on Sunday
evening.&nbsp; He was the most singularly placid, even-tempered
person I ever knew.&nbsp; I first became acquainted with him when
I was a child and he was past middle life.&nbsp; What he was
then, I am told, he always was; and I certainly never heard one
single violent word escape his lips.&nbsp; His habits, even when
young, had a tendency to harden.&nbsp; He went to sleep after his
mid-day dinner with the greatest regularity, and he never could
keep awake if he sat by a fire after dark.&nbsp; I have seen him,
when kneeling at family worship and praying with his family, lose
himself for an instant and nod his head, to the confusion of all
who were around him.&nbsp; He is dead now, but he lived to a good
old age, which crept upon him gradually with no pain, and he
passed away from this world to the next in a peaceful doze.&nbsp;
He never read anything, for the simple reason that whenever he
was not at work or at chapel he slumbered.&nbsp; To the utter
amazement of everybody, it was announced one fine day that Miss
Leroy and he&mdash;George Butts&mdash;were to be married.&nbsp;
They were about the last people in the world, who, it was
thought, could be brought together.&nbsp; My mother was stunned,
and never completely recovered.&nbsp; I have seen her, forty
years after George Butts&rsquo; wedding-day, lift up her hands,
and have heard her call out with emotion, as fresh as if the
event were of yesterday, &ldquo;What made that girl have George I
can <i>not</i> think&mdash;but there!&rdquo;&nbsp; What she meant
by the last two words we could not comprehend.&nbsp; Many of her
acquaintances interpreted them to mean that she knew more than
she dared communicate, but I think they were mistaken.&nbsp; I am
quite certain if she had known anything she must have told it,
and, in the next place, the phrase &ldquo;but there&rdquo; was
not uncommon amongst women in our town, and was supposed to mark
the consciousness of a prudently restrained ability to give an
explanation of mysterious phenomena in human relationships.&nbsp;
For my own part, I am just as much in the dark as my
mother.&nbsp; My father, who was a shrewd man, was always
puzzled, and could not read the riddle.&nbsp; He used to say that
he never thought George could have &ldquo;made up&rdquo; to any
young woman, and it was quite clear that Miss Leroy did not
either then or afterwards display any violent affection for
him.&nbsp; I have heard her criticise and patronise him as a
&ldquo;good soul,&rdquo; but incapable, as indeed he was, of all
sympathy with her.&nbsp; After marriage she went her way and he
his.&nbsp; She got up early, as she was wont to do, and took her
Bible into the fields while he was snoring.&nbsp; She would then
very likely suffer from a terrible headache during the rest of
the day, and lie down for hours, letting the house manage itself
as best it could.&nbsp; What made her selection of George more
obscure was that she was much admired by many young fellows, some
of whom were certainly more akin to her than he was; and I have
heard from one or two reports of encouraging words, and even
something more than words, which she had vouchsafed to
them.&nbsp; A solution is impossible.&nbsp; The affinities,
repulsions, reasons in a nature like that of Miss Leroy&rsquo;s
are so secret and so subtle, working towards such incalculable
and not-to-be-predicted results, that to attempt to make a major
and minor premiss and an inevitable conclusion out of them would
be useless.&nbsp; One thing was clear, that by marrying George
she gained great freedom.&nbsp; If she had married anybody closer
to her, she might have jarred with him; there might have been
collision and wreck as complete as if they had been entirely
opposed; for she was not the kind of person to accommodate
herself to others even in the matter of small differences.&nbsp;
But George&rsquo;s road through space lay entirely apart from
hers, and there was not the slightest chance of
interference.&nbsp; She was under the protection of a husband;
she could do things that, as an unmarried woman, especially in a
foreign land, she could not do, and the compensatory sacrifice to
her was small.&nbsp; This is really the only attempt at
elucidation I can give.&nbsp; She went regularly all her life to
chapel with George, but even when he became deacon, and
&ldquo;supplied&rdquo; the villages round, she never would join
the church as a member.&nbsp; She never agreed with the minister,
and he never could make anything out of her.&nbsp; They did not
quarrel, but she thought nothing of his sermons, and he was
perplexed and uncomfortable in the presence of a nondescript who
did not respond to any dogmatic statement of the articles of
religion, and who yet could not be put aside as &ldquo;one of
those in the gallery&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, as one of the
ordinary unconverted, for she used to quote hymns with amazing
fervour, and she quoted them to him with a freedom and a certain
superiority which he might have expected from an aged brother
minister, but certainly not from one of his own
congregation.&nbsp; He was a preacher of the Gospel, it was true;
and it was his duty, a duty on which he insisted, to be
&ldquo;instant in season and out of season&rdquo; in saying
spiritual things to his flock; but then they were things proper,
decent, conventional, uttered with gravity at suitable
times&mdash;such as were customary amongst all the ministers of
the denomination.&nbsp; It was not pleasant to be outbid in his
own department, especially by one who was not a communicant, and
to be obliged, when he went on a pastoral visit to a house in
which Mrs. Butts happened to be, to sit still and hear her,
regardless of the minister&rsquo;s presence, conclude a short
mystical monologue with Cowper&rsquo;s verse&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Exults our rising soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Disburdened of her load,<br />
And swells unutterably full<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of glory and of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was <i>not</i> pleasant to our minister, nor was it
pleasant to the minister&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; But George Butts
held a responsible position in our community, and the
minister&rsquo;s wife held also a responsible position, so that
she taxed all her ingenuity to let her friends understand at
tea-parties what she thought of Mrs. Butts without saying
anything which could be the ground of formal remonstrance.&nbsp;
Thus did Mrs. Butts live among us, as an Arabian bird with its
peculiar habits, cries, and plumage might live in one of our
barn-yards with the ordinary barn-door fowls.</p>
<p>I was never happier when I was a boy than when I was with Mrs.
Butts at the mill, which George had inherited.&nbsp; There was a
grand freedom in her house.&nbsp; The front door leading into the
garden was always open.&nbsp; There was no precise separation
between the house and the mill.&nbsp; The business and the
dwelling-place were mixed up together, and covered with
flour.&nbsp; Mr. Butts was in the habit of walking out of his
mill into the living-room every now and then, and never dreamed
when one o&rsquo;clock came that it was necessary for him to
change his floury coat before he had his dinner.&nbsp; His cap he
also often retained, and in any weather, not extraordinarily
cold, he sat in his shirtsleeves.&nbsp; The garden was large and
half-wild.&nbsp; A man from the mill, if work was slack, gave a
day to it now and then, but it was not trimmed and raked and
combed like the other gardens in the town.&nbsp; It was full of
gooseberry trees, and I was permitted to eat the gooseberries
without stint.&nbsp; The mill-life, too, was inexpressibly
attractive&mdash;the dark chamber with the great, green, dripping
wheel in it, so awfully mysterious as the central life of the
whole structure; the machinery connected with the wheel&mdash;I
knew not how; the hole where the roach lay by the side of the
mill-tail in the eddy; the haunts of the water-rats which we used
to hunt with Spot, the black and tan terrier, and the still more
exciting sport with the ferrets&mdash;all this drew me down the
lane perpetually.&nbsp; I liked, and even loved Mrs. Butts, too,
for her own sake.&nbsp; Her kindness to me was unlimited, and she
was never overcome with the fear of &ldquo;spoiling me,&rdquo;
which seemed the constant dread of most of my hostesses.&nbsp; I
never lost my love for her.&nbsp; It grew as I grew, despite my
mother&rsquo;s scarcely suppressed hostility to her, and when I
heard she was ill, and was likely to die, I went to be with
her.&nbsp; She was eighty years old then.&nbsp; I sat by her
bedside with her hand in mine.&nbsp; I was there when she passed
away, and&mdash;but I have no mind and no power to say any more,
for all the memories of her affection and of the sunny days by
the water come over me and prevent the calmness necessary for a
chronicle.&nbsp; She with all her faults and eccentricities will
always have in my heart a little chapel with an ever-burning
light.&nbsp; She was one of the very very few whom I have ever
seen who knew how to love a child.</p>
<p>Mrs. Butts and George had one son who was named Clement.&nbsp;
He was exactly my own age, and naturally we were constant
companions.&nbsp; We went to the same school.&nbsp; He never
distinguished himself at his books, but he was chief among
us.&nbsp; He had a versatile talent for almost every
accomplishment in which we delighted, but he was not supreme in
any one of them.&nbsp; There were better cricketers, better
football players, better hands at setting a night-line, better
swimmers than Clem, but he could do something, and do it well, in
all these departments.&nbsp; He generally took up a thing with
much eagerness for a time, and then let it drop.&nbsp; He was
foremost in introducing new games and new fashions, which he
permitted to flourish for a time, and then superseded.&nbsp; As
he grew up he displayed a taste for drawing and music.&nbsp; He
was soon able to copy little paintings of flowers, or even little
country scenes, and to play a piece of no very great difficulty
with tolerable effect.&nbsp; But as he never was taught by a
master, and never practised elementary exercises and studies, he
was deficient in accuracy.&nbsp; When the question came what was
to be done with him after he left school, his father naturally
wished him to go into the mill.&nbsp; Clem, however, set his face
steadily against this project, and his mother, who was a believer
in his genius, supported him.&nbsp; He actually wanted to go to
the University, a thing unheard of in those days amongst our
people; but this was not possible, and after dangling about for
some time at home, he obtained the post of usher in a school, an
occupation which he considered more congenial and intellectual
than that of grinding flour.&nbsp; Strange to say, although he
knew less than any of his colleagues, he succeeded better than
any of them.&nbsp; He managed to impress a sense of his own
importance upon everybody, including the headmaster.&nbsp; He
slid into a position of superiority above three or four
colleagues who would have shamed him at an examination, and who
uttered many a curse because they saw themselves surpassed and
put in the shade by a stranger, who, they were confident, could
hardly construct a hexameter.&nbsp; He never quarrelled with them
nor did he grossly patronise them, but he always let them know
that he considered himself above them.&nbsp; His reading was
desultory; in fact, everything he did was desultory.&nbsp; He was
not selfish in the ordinary sense of the word.&nbsp; Rather was
he distinguished by a large and liberal open-handedness; but he
was liberal also to himself to a remarkable degree, dressing
himself expensively, and spending a good deal of money in
luxuries.&nbsp; He was specially fond of insisting on his half
French origin, made a great deal of his mother, was silent as to
his father, and always signed himself C. Leroy Butts, although I
don&rsquo;t believe the second Christian name was given him in
baptism.&nbsp; Notwithstanding his generosity he was egotistical
and hollow at heart.&nbsp; He knew nothing of friendship in the
best sense of the word, but had a multitude of acquaintances,
whom he invariably sought amongst those who were better off than
himself.&nbsp; He was popular with them, for no man knew better
than he how to get up an entertainment, or to make a success of
an evening party.&nbsp; He had not been at his school for two
years before he conceived the notion of setting up for
himself.&nbsp; He had not a penny, but he borrowed easily what
was wanted from somebody he knew, and in a twelvemonth more he
had a dozen pupils.&nbsp; He took care to get the ablest
subordinates he could find, and he succeeded in passing a boy for
an open scholarship at Oxford, against two competitors prepared
by the very man whom he had formerly served.&nbsp; After this he
prospered greatly, and would have prospered still more, if his
love of show and extravagance had not increased with his
income.&nbsp; His talents were sometimes taxed when people who
came to place their sons with him supposed ignorantly that his
origin and attainments were what might be expected from his
position; and poor Chalmers, a Glasgow M.A., who still taught,
for &pound;80 a year, the third class in the establishment in
which Butts began life, had some bitter stories on that
subject.&nbsp; Chalmers was a perfect scholar, but he was not
agreeable.&nbsp; He had black finger-nails, and wore dirty
collars.&nbsp; Having a lively remembrance of his friend&rsquo;s
&ldquo;general acquaintance&rdquo; with Latin prosody,
Chalmers&rsquo; opinion of Providence was much modified when he
discovered what Providence was doing for Butts.&nbsp; Clem took
to the Church when he started for himself.&nbsp; It would have
been madness in him to remain a Dissenter.&nbsp; But in private,
if it suited his purpose, he could always be airily sceptical,
and he had a superficial acquaintance, second-hand, with a
multitude of books, many of them of an infidel turn.&nbsp; I once
rebuked him for his hypocrisy, and his defence was that religious
disputes were indifferent to him, and that at any rate a man
associates with gentlemen if he is a churchman.&nbsp; Cultivation
and manners he thought to be of more importance than
Calvinism.&nbsp; I believe that he partly meant what he
said.&nbsp; He went to church because the school would have
failed if he had gone to chapel; but he was sufficiently
keen-sighted and clever to be beyond the petty quarrels of the
sects, and a song well sung was of much greater moment to him
than an essay on p&aelig;do-baptism.&nbsp; It was all very well
of Chalmers to revile him for his shallowness.&nbsp; He was
shallow, and yet he possessed in some mysterious way a talent
which I greatly coveted, and which in this world is inestimably
precious&mdash;the talent of making people give way before
him&mdash;a capacity of self-impression.&nbsp; Chalmers could
never have commanded anybody.&nbsp; He had no power whatever,
even when he was right, to put his will against the wills of
others, but yielded first this way and then the other.&nbsp;
Clem, on the contrary, without any difficulty or any effort,
could conquer all opposition, and smilingly force everybody to do
his bidding.</p>
<p>Clem had a peculiar theory with regard to his own rights and
those of the class to which he considered that he belonged.&nbsp;
He always held implicitly and sometimes explicitly that gifted
people live under a kind of dispensation of grace; the law
existing solely for dull souls.&nbsp; What in a clown is a crime
punishable by the laws of the land might in a man of genius be a
necessary development, or at any rate an excusable offence.&nbsp;
He had nothing to say for the servant-girl who had sinned with
the shopman, but if artist or poet were to carry off another
man&rsquo;s wife, it might not be wrong.</p>
<p>He believed, and acted upon the belief, that the inferior
ought to render perpetual incense to the superior, and that the
superior should receive it as a matter of course.&nbsp; When his
father was ill he never waited on him or sat up a single night
with him.&nbsp; If duty was disagreeable to him Clem paid homage
to it afar off, but pleaded exemption.&nbsp; He admitted that
waiting on the sick is obligatory on people who are fitted for
it, and is very charming.&nbsp; Nothing was more beautiful to him
than tender, filial care spending itself for a beloved
object.&nbsp; But it was not his vocation.&nbsp; His nerves were
more finely ordered than those of mankind generally, and the
sight of disease and suffering distressed him too much.&nbsp;
Everything was surrendered to him in the houses of his
friends.&nbsp; If any inconvenience was to be endured, he was the
first person to be protected from it, and he accepted the
greatest sacrifices, with a graceful acknowledgment, it is true,
but with no repulse.&nbsp; To what better purpose could the best
wine be put than in cherishing his imagination.&nbsp; It was
simple waste to allow it to be poured out upon the earth, and to
give it to a fool was no better.&nbsp; After he succeeded so well
in the world, Clem, to a great extent, deserted me, although I
was his oldest friend and the friend of his childhood.&nbsp; I
heard that he visited a good many rich persons, that he made much
of them, and they made much of him.&nbsp; He kept up a kind of
acquaintance with me, not by writing to me, but by the very cheap
mode of sending me a newspaper now and then with a marked
paragraph in it announcing the exploits of his school at a
cricket-match, or occasionally with a report of a lecture which
he had delivered.&nbsp; He was a decent orator, and from motives
of business if from no other, he not unfrequently spoke in
public.&nbsp; One or two of these lectures wounded me a good
deal.&nbsp; There was one in particular on <i>As You Like It</i>,
in which he held up to admiration the fidelity which is so
remarkable in Shakespeare, and lamented that in these days it was
so rare to find anything of the kind, he thought that we were
becoming more indifferent to one another.&nbsp; He maintained,
however, that man should be everything to man, and he then
enlarged on the duty of really cultivating affection, of its
superiority to books, and on the pleasure and profit of
self-denial.&nbsp; I do not mean to accuse Clem of downright
hypocrisy.&nbsp; I have known many persons come up from the
country and go into raptures over a playhouse sun and moon who
have never bestowed a glance or a thought on the real sun and
moon to be seen from their own doors; and we are all aware it by
no means follows because we are moved to our very depths by the
spectacle of unrecognised, uncomplaining endurance in a novel,
that therefore we can step over the road to waste an hour or a
sixpence upon the unrecognised, uncomplaining endurance of the
poor lone woman left a widow in the little villa there.&nbsp; I
was annoyed with myself because Clem&rsquo;s abandonment of me so
much affected me.&nbsp; I wished I could cut the rope and
carelessly cast him adrift as he had cast me adrift, but I could
not.&nbsp; I never could make out and cannot make out what was
the secret of his influence over me; why I was unable to say,
&ldquo;If you do not care for me I do not care for
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I longed sometimes for complete rupture, so
that we might know exactly where we were, but it never
came.&nbsp; Gradually our intercourse grew thinner and thinner,
until at last I heard that he had been spending a fortnight with
some semi-aristocratic acquaintance within five miles of me, and
during the whole of that time he never came near me.&nbsp; I met
him in a railway station soon afterwards, when he came up to me
effusive and apparently affectionate.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a real
grief to me, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I could
not call on you last month, but the truth was I was so driven:
they would make me go here and go there, and I kept putting off
my visit to you till it was too late.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fortunately my
train was just starting, or I don&rsquo;t know what might have
happened.&nbsp; I said not a word; shook hands with him; got into
the carriage; he waved his hat to me, and I pretended not to see
him, but I did see him, and saw him turn round immediately to
some well-dressed officer-like gentleman with whom he walked
laughing down the platform.&nbsp; The rest of that day was black
to me.&nbsp; I cared for nothing.&nbsp; I passed away from the
thought of Clem, and dwelt upon the conviction which had long
possessed me that I was <i>insignificant</i>, that there was
<i>nothing much in me</i>, and it was this which destroyed my
peace.&nbsp; We may reconcile ourselves to poverty and suffering,
but few of us can endure the conviction that there is <i>nothing
in us</i>, and that consequently we cannot expect anybody to
gravitate towards us with any forceful impulse.&nbsp; It is a
bitter experience.&nbsp; And yet there is consolation.&nbsp; The
universe is infinite.&nbsp; In the presence of its celestial
magnitudes who is there who is really great or small, and what is
the difference between you and me, my work and yours?&nbsp; I
sought refuge in the idea of GOD, the God of a starry night with
its incomprehensible distances; and I was at peace, content to be
the meanest worm of all the millions that crawl on the earth.</p>

62</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A NECESSARY DEVELOPMENT</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> few friends who have read the
first part of my autobiography may perhaps remember that in my
younger days I had engaged myself to a girl named Ellen, from
whom afterwards I parted.&nbsp; After some two or three years she
was left an orphan, and came into the possession of a small
property, over which unfortunately she had complete power.&nbsp;
She was attractive and well-educated, and I heard long after I
had broken with her, and had ceased to have intercourse with
Butts, that the two were married.&nbsp; He of course, living so
near her, had known her well, and he found her money
useful.&nbsp; How they agreed I knew not save by report, but I
was told that after the first child was born, the only child they
ever had, Butts grew indifferent to her, and that she, to use my
friend&rsquo;s expression, &ldquo;went off,&rdquo; by which I
suppose he meant that she faded.&nbsp; There happened in those
days to live near Butts a small squire, married, but with no
family.&nbsp; He was a lethargic creature, about five-and-thirty
years old, farming eight hundred acres of his own land.&nbsp; He
did not, however, belong to the farming class.&nbsp; He had been
to Harrow, was on the magistrates&rsquo; bench, and associated
with the small aristocracy of the country round.&nbsp; He was
like every other squire whom I remember in my native county, and
I can remember scores of them.&nbsp; He read no books and
tolerated the usual conventional breaches of the moral law, but
was an intense worshipper of respectability, and hated a
scandal.&nbsp; On one point he differed from his
neighbours.&nbsp; He was a Whig and they were all Tories.&nbsp; I
have said he read no books, and this, on the whole, is true, but
nevertheless he did know something about the history of the early
part of the century, and he was rather fond at political
gatherings of making some allusion to Mr. Fox.&nbsp; His father
had sat in the House of Commons when Fox was there, and had
sternly opposed the French war.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose that
anybody not actually <i>in it</i>&mdash;no Londoner
certainly&mdash;can understand the rigidity of the bonds which
restricted county society when I was young, and for aught I know
may restrict it now.&nbsp; There was with us one huge and dark
exception to the general uniformity.&nbsp; The earl had broken
loose, had ruined his estate, had defied decorum and openly lived
with strange women at home and in Paris, but this black
background did but set off the otherwise universal adhesion to
the Church and to authorised manners, an adhesion tempered and
rendered tolerable by port wine.&nbsp; It must not, however, be
supposed that human nature was different from the human nature of
to-day or a thousand years ago.&nbsp; There were then, even as
there were a thousand years ago, and are to-day, small, secret
doors, connected with mysterious staircases, by which access was
gained to freedom; and men and women, inmates of castles with
walls a yard thick, and impenetrable portcullises, sought those
doors and descended those stairs night and day.&nbsp; But nobody
knew, or if we did know, the silence was profound.&nbsp; The
broad-shouldered, yellow-haired Whig squire, had a wife who was
the opposite of him.&nbsp; She came from a distant part of the
country, and had been educated in France.&nbsp; She was small,
with black hair, and yet with blue eyes.&nbsp; She spoke French
perfectly, was devoted to music, read French books, and, although
she was a constant attendant at church, and gave no opportunity
whatever for the slightest suspicion, the matrons of the circle
in which she moved were never quite happy about her.&nbsp; This
was due partly to her knowledge of French, and partly to her
having no children.&nbsp; Anything more about her I do not
know.&nbsp; She was beyond us, and although I have seen her often
enough I never spoke to her.&nbsp; Butts, however, managed to
become a visitor at the squire&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Fancy
<i>my</i> going to the squire&rsquo;s!&nbsp; But Butts did, was
accepted there, and even dined there with a parson, and two or
three half-pay officers.&nbsp; The squire never called on
Butts.&nbsp; That was an understood thing, nor did Mrs. Butts
accompany her husband.&nbsp; That also was an understood
thing.&nbsp; It was strange that Butts could tolerate and even
court such a relationship.&nbsp; Most men would scorn with the
scorn of a personal insult an invitation to a house from which
their wives were expressly excluded.&nbsp; The squire&rsquo;s
lady and Clem became great friends.&nbsp; She discovered that his
mother was a Frenchwoman, and this was a bond between them.&nbsp;
She discovered also that Clem was artistic, that he was devotedly
fond of music, that he could draw a little, paint a little, and
she believed in the divine right of talent wherever it might be
found to assert a claim of equality with those who were better
born.&nbsp; The women in the country-side were shy of her; for
the men she could not possibly care, and no doubt she must at
times have got rather weary of her heavy husband with his one
outlook towards the universal in the person of George James Fox,
and the Whig policy of 1802.&nbsp; I am under some disadvantage
in telling this part of my story, because I was far away from
home, and only knew afterwards at second hand what the course of
events had been; but I learned them from one who was intimately
concerned, and I do not think I can be mistaken on any essential
point.&nbsp; I imagine that by this time Mrs. Butts must have
become changed into what she was in later years.&nbsp; She had
grown older since she and I had parted; she had seen trouble; her
child had been born, and although she was not exactly estranged
from Clem, for neither he nor she would have admitted any
coolness, she had learned that she was nothing specially to
him.&nbsp; I have often noticed what an imperceptible touch, what
a slight shifting in the balance of opposing forces, will alter
the character.&nbsp; I have observed a woman, for example,
essentially the same at twenty and thirty&mdash;who is there who
is not always essentially the same?&mdash;and yet, what was a
defect at twenty, has become transformed and transfigured into a
benignant virtue at thirty; translating the whole nature from the
human to the divine.&nbsp; Some slight depression has been
wrought here, and some slight lift has been given there, and
beauty and order have miraculously emerged from what was
chaotic.&nbsp; The same thing may continually be noticed in the
hereditary transmission of qualities.&nbsp; The redeeming virtue
of the father palpably present in the son becomes his curse,
through a faint diminution of the strength of the check which
caused that virtue to be the father&rsquo;s salvation.&nbsp; The
propensity, too, which is a man&rsquo;s evil genius, and leads
him to madness and utter ruin, gives vivid reality to all his
words and thoughts, and becomes all his strength, if by divine
assistance it can just be subdued and prevented from rising in
victorious insurrection.&nbsp; But this is a digression, useful,
however, in its way, because it will explain Mrs. Butts when we
come a little nearer to her in the future.</p>
<p>For a time Clem&rsquo;s visits to the squire&rsquo;s house
always took place when the squire was at home, but an amateur
concert was to be arranged in which Clem was to take part
together with the squire&rsquo;s lady.&nbsp; Clem consequently
was obliged to go to the Hall for the purpose of practising, and
so it came to pass that he was there at unusual hours and when
the master was afield.&nbsp; These morning and afternoon calls
did not cease when the concert was over.&nbsp; Clem&rsquo;s wife
did not know anything about them, and, if she noticed his
frequent absence, she was met with an excuse.&nbsp; Perhaps the
worst, or almost the worst effect of relationships which we do
not like to acknowledge, is the secrecy and equivocation which
they beget.&nbsp; From the very first moment when the intimacy
between the squire&rsquo;s wife and Clem began to be anything
more than harmless, he was compelled to shuffle and to become
contemptible.&nbsp; At the same time I believe he defended
himself against himself with the weapons which were ever ready
when self rose against self because of some wrong-doing.&nbsp; He
was not as other men.&nbsp; It was absurd to class what he did
with what an ordinary person might do, although externally his
actions and those of the ordinary person might resemble one
another.&nbsp; I cannot trace the steps by which the two sinners
drew nearer and nearer together, for the simple reason that this
is an autobiography, and not a novel.&nbsp; I do not know what
the development was, nor did anybody except the person
concerned.&nbsp; Neither do I know what was the mental history of
Mrs. Butts during this unhappy period.&nbsp; She seldom talked
about it afterwards.&nbsp; I do, however, happen to recollect
hearing her once say that her greatest trouble was the cessation,
from some unknown cause, of Clem&rsquo;s attempts&mdash;they were
never many&mdash;to interest and amuse her.&nbsp; It is easy to
understand how this should be.&nbsp; If a man is guilty of any
defection from himself, of anything of which he is ashamed,
everything which is better becomes a farce to him.&nbsp; After he
has been betrayed by some passion, how can he pretend to the
perfect enjoyment of what is pure?&nbsp; The moment he feels any
disposition to rise, he is stricken through as if with an arrow,
and he drops.&nbsp; Not until weeks, months, and even years have
elapsed, does he feel justified in surrendering himself to a
noble emotion.&nbsp; I have heard of persons who have been able
to ascend easily and instantaneously from the mud to the upper
air, and descend as easily; but to me at least they are
incomprehensible.&nbsp; Clem, less than most men, suffered
permanently, or indeed in any way from remorse, because he was so
shielded by his peculiar philosophy; but I can quite believe that
when he got into the habit of calling at the Hall at mid-day, his
behaviour to his wife changed.</p>
<p>One day in December the squire had gone out with the
hounds.&nbsp; Clem, going on from bad to worse, had now reached
the point of planning to be at the Hall when the squire was not
at home.&nbsp; On that particular afternoon Clem was there.&nbsp;
It was about half-past four o&rsquo;clock, and the master was not
expected till six.&nbsp; There had been some music, the lady
accompanying, and Clem singing.&nbsp; It was over, and Clem,
sitting down beside her at the piano, and pointing out with his
right hand some passage which had troubled him, had placed his
left arm on her shoulder, and round her neck, she not
resisting.&nbsp; He always swore afterwards that never till then
had such a familiarity as this been permitted, and I believe that
he did not tell a lie.&nbsp; But what was there in that
familiarity?&nbsp; The worst was already there, and it was
through a mere accident that it never showed itself.&nbsp; The
accident was this.&nbsp; The squire, for some unknown reason, had
returned earlier than usual, and dismounting in the stable-yard,
had walked round the garden on the turf which came close to the
windows of the ground floor.&nbsp; Passing the drawing-room
window, and looking in by the edge of the drawn-down blind, he
saw his wife and Clem just at the moment described.&nbsp; He
slipped round to the door, took off his boots so that he might
not be heard, and as there was a large screen inside the room he
was able to enter it unobserved.&nbsp; Clem caught sight of him
just as he emerged from behind the screen, and started up
instantly in great confusion, the lady, with greater presence of
mind, remaining perfectly still.&nbsp; Without a word the squire
strode up to Clem, struck out at him, caught him just over the
temple, and felled him instantaneously.&nbsp; He lay for some
time senseless, and what passed between husband and wife I cannot
say.&nbsp; After about ten minutes, perhaps, Clem came to
himself; there was nobody to be seen; and he managed to get up
and crawl home.&nbsp; He told his wife he had met with an
accident; that he would go to bed, and that she should know all
about it when he was better.&nbsp; His forehead was dressed, and
to bed he went.&nbsp; That night Mrs. Butts had a letter.&nbsp;
It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;It
may at first sight seem a harsh thing for me to write and tell
you what I have to say, but I can assure you I do not mean to be
anything but kind to you, and I think it will be better, for
reasons which I will afterwards explain, that I should
communicate with you rather than with your husband.&nbsp; For
some time past I have suspected that he was too fond of my wife,
and last night I caught him with his arms round her neck.&nbsp;
In a moment of not unjustifiable anger I knocked him down.&nbsp;
I have not the honour of knowing you personally, but from what I
have heard of you I am sure that he has not the slightest reason
for playing with other women.&nbsp; A man who will do what he has
done will be very likely to conceal from you the true cause of
his disaster, and if you know the cause you may perhaps be able
to reclaim him.&nbsp; If he has any sense of honour left in him,
and of what is due to you, he will seek your pardon for his
baseness, and you will have a hold on him afterwards which you
would not have if you were in ignorance of what has
happened.&nbsp; For him I do not care a straw, but for you I feel
deeply, and I believe that my frankness with you, although it may
cause you much suffering now, will save you more hereafter.&nbsp;
I have only one condition to make.&nbsp; Mr. Butts must leave
this place, and never let me see his face again.&nbsp; He has
ruined my peace.&nbsp; Nothing will be published through me, for,
as far as I can prevent it, I will have no public exposure.&nbsp;
If Mr. Butts were to remain here it would be dangerous for us to
meet, and probably everything, by some chance, would become
common property.&mdash;Believe me to be, Madam, with many
assurances of respect, truly yours,&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot distinguish the precise proportion of cruelty in this
letter.&nbsp; Did the writer designedly torture Butts by telling
his wife, or did he really think that she would in the end be
happier because Butts would not have a secret reserved from
her,&mdash;a temptation to lying&mdash;and because with this
secret in her possession, he might perhaps be restrained in
future?&nbsp; Nobody knows.&nbsp; All we know is that there are
very few human actions of which it can be said that this or that
taken by itself produced them.&nbsp; With our inborn tendency to
abstract, to separate mentally the concrete into factors which do
not exist separately, we are always disposed to assign causes
which are too simple, and which, in fact, have no being <i>in
rerum natura</i>.&nbsp; Nothing in nature is propelled or impeded
by one force acting alone.&nbsp; There is no such thing, save in
the brain of the mathematician.&nbsp; I see no reason why even
motives diametrically opposite should not unite in one resulting
deed, and think it very probable that the squire was both cruel
and merciful to the same person in the letter; influenced by
exactly conflicting passions, whose conflict ended <i>so</i>.</p>
<p>As to the squire and his wife, they lived together just as
before.&nbsp; I do not think, that, excepting the four persons
concerned, anybody ever heard a syllable about the affair, save
myself a long while afterwards.&nbsp; Clem, however, packed up
and left the town, after selling his business.&nbsp; He had a
reputation for restlessness; and his departure, although it was
sudden, was no surprise.&nbsp; He betook himself to Australia,
his wife going with him.&nbsp; I heard that they had gone, and
heard also that he was tired of school-keeping in England, and
had determined to try his fortune in another part of the
world.&nbsp; Our friendship had dwindled to nothing, and I
thought no more about him.&nbsp; Mrs. Butts never uttered one
word of reproach to her husband.&nbsp; I cannot say that she
loved him as she could have loved, but she had accepted him, and
she said to herself that as perhaps it was through her lack of
sympathy with him that he had strayed, it was her duty more and
more to draw him to herself.&nbsp; She had a divine disposition,
not infrequent amongst women, to seek in herself the reason for
any wrong which was done to her.&nbsp; That almost instinctive
tendency in men, to excuse, to transfer blame to others, to be
angry with somebody else when they suffer from the consequences
of their own misdeeds, in her did not exist.</p>
<p>During almost the whole of her married life, before this
affair between the squire and Clem, Mrs. Butts had had much
trouble, although her trouble was, perhaps, rather the absence of
joy than the presence of any poignant grief.&nbsp; She was much
by herself.&nbsp; She had never been a great reader, but in her
frequent solitude she was forced to do something in order to
obtain relief, and she naturally turned to the Bible.&nbsp; It
would be foolish to say that the Bible alone was to be credited
with the support she received.&nbsp; It may only have been the
occasion for a revelation of the strength that was in her.&nbsp;
Reading, however, under such circumstances, is likely to be
peculiarly profitable.&nbsp; It is never so profitable as when it
is undertaken in order that a positive need may be satisfied or
an inquiry answered.&nbsp; She discovered in the Bible much that
persons to whom it is a mere literature would never find.&nbsp;
The water of life was not merely admirable to the eye; she drank
it, and knew what a property it possessed for quenching
thirst.&nbsp; No doubt the thought of a heaven hereafter was
especially consolatory.&nbsp; She was able to endure, and even to
be happy because the vision of lengthening sorrow was bounded by
a better world beyond.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very poor, barbarous
gospel,&rdquo; thinks the philosopher who rests on his Marcus
Antoninus and Epictetus.&nbsp; I do not mean to say, that in the
shape in which she believed this doctrine, it was not poor and
barbarous, but yet we all of us, whatever our creed may be, must
lay hold at times for salvation upon something like it.&nbsp;
Those who have been plunged up to the very lips in affliction
know its necessity.&nbsp; To such as these it is idle work for
the prosperous and the comfortable to preach satisfaction with
the life that now is.&nbsp; There are seasons when it is our sole
resource to recollect that in a few short years we shall be at
rest.&nbsp; While upon this subject I may say, too, that some
injustice has been done to the Christian creed of immortality as
an influence in determining men&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp; Paul
preached the imminent advent of Christ and besought his
disciples, therefore, to watch, and we ask ourselves what is the
moral value to us of such an admonition.&nbsp; But surely if we
are to have any reasons for being virtuous, this is as good as
any other.&nbsp; It is just as respectable to believe that we
ought to abstain from iniquity because Christ is at hand, and we
expect to meet Him, as to abstain from it because by our
abstention we shall be healthier or more prosperous.&nbsp; Paul
had a dream&mdash;an absurd dream let us call it&mdash;of an
immediate millennium, and of the return of his Master surrounded
with divine splendour, judging mankind and adjusting the balance
between good and evil.&nbsp; It was a baseless dream, and the
enlightened may call it ridiculous.&nbsp; It is anything but
that, it is the very opposite of that.&nbsp; Putting aside its
temporary mode of expression, it is the hope and the prophecy of
all noble hearts, a sign of their inability to concur in the
present condition of things.</p>
<p>Going back to Clem&rsquo;s wife; she laid hold, as I have
said, upon heaven.&nbsp; The thought wrought in her something
more than forgetfulness of pain or the expectation of
counterpoising bliss.&nbsp; We can understand what this something
was, for although we know no such heaven as hers, a new temper is
imparted to us, a new spirit breathed into us; I was about to say
a new hope bestowed upon us, when we consider that we live
surrounded by the soundless depths in which the stars
repose.&nbsp; Such a consideration has a direct practical effect
upon us, and so had the future upon the mind of Mrs. Butts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why dost thou judge thy brother,&rdquo; says Paul,
&ldquo;for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Paul does not mean that God will punish him and
that we may rest satisfied that our enemy will be turned into
hell fire.&nbsp; Rather does he mean, what we, too, feel, that,
reflecting on the great idea of God, and upon all that it
involves, our animosities are softened, and our heat against our
brother is cooled.</p>
<p>One or two reflections may perhaps be permitted here on this
passage in Mrs. Butts&rsquo; history.</p>
<p>The fidelity of Clem&rsquo;s wife to him, if not entirely due
to the New Testament, was in a great measure traceable to
it.&nbsp; She had learned from the Epistle to the Corinthians
that charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all
things, endureth all things; and she interpreted this to mean,
not merely charity to those whom she loved by nature, but charity
to those with whom she was not in sympathy, and who even wronged
her.&nbsp; Christianity no doubt does teach such a charity as
this, a love which is to be: independent of mere personal likes
and dislikes, a love of the human in man.&nbsp; The natural man,
the man of this century, uncontrolled by Christianity, considers
himself a model of what is virtuous and heroic if he really loves
his friends, and he permits all kinds of savage antipathies to
those of his fellow creatures with whom he is not in
harmony.&nbsp; Jesus on the other hand asks with His usual
perfect simplicity, &ldquo;If ye love them which love you, what
reward have ye?&nbsp; Do not even the publicans the
same?&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be a great step in advance for most
of us to love anybody, and the publicans of the time of Jesus
must have been a much more Christian set than most Christians of
the present day; but that we should love those who do not love us
is a height never scaled now, except by a few of the elect in
whom Christ still survives.&nbsp; In the gospel of Luke, also,
Mrs. Butts read that she was to hope for nothing again from her
love, and that she was to be merciful, as her Father in heaven is
merciful.&nbsp; That is really the expression of the <i>idea</i>
in morality, and incalculable is the blessing that our great
religious teacher should have been bold enough to teach the idea,
and not any limitation of it.&nbsp; He always taught it, the
inward born, the heavenly law towards which everything
strives.&nbsp; He always trusted it; He did not deal in
exceptions; He relied on it to the uttermost, never
despairing.&nbsp; This has always seemed to me to be the real
meaning of the word faith.&nbsp; It is permanent confidence in
the idea, a confidence never to be broken down by apparent
failure, or by examples by which ordinary people prove that
qualification is necessary.&nbsp; It was precisely because Jesus
taught the idea, and nothing below it, that He had such authority
over a soul like my friend&rsquo;s, and the effect produced by
Him could not have been produced by anybody nearer to ordinary
humanity.</p>
<p>It must be admitted, too, that the Calvinism of those days had
a powerful influence in enabling men and women to endure,
although I object to giving the name of Calvin to a philosophy
which is a necessity in all ages.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are not two
sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on
the ground without your Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the last
word which can be said.&nbsp; Nothing can go beyond it, and at
times it is the only ground which we feel does not shake under
our feet.&nbsp; All life is summed up, and due account is taken
of it, according to its degree.&nbsp; Mrs. Butts&rsquo;
Calvinism, however, hardly took the usual dogmatic form.&nbsp;
She was too simple to penetrate the depths of metaphysical
theology, and she never would have dared to set down any of her
fellow creatures as irrevocably lost.&nbsp; She adapted the
Calvinistic creed to something which suited her.&nbsp; For
example, she fully understood what St. Paul means when he tells
the Thessalonians that <i>because</i> they were called,
<i>therefore</i> they were to stand fast.&nbsp; She thought with
Paul that being called; having a duty plainly laid upon her;
being bidden as if by a general to do something, she <i>ought</i>
to stand fast; and she stood fast, supported against all pressure
by the consciousness of fulfilling the special orders of One who
was her superior.&nbsp; There is no doubt that this dogma of a
personal calling is a great consolation, and it is a great
truth.&nbsp; Looking at the masses of humanity, driven this way
and that way, the Christian teaching is apt to be forgotten that
for each individual soul there is a vocation as real as if that
soul were alone upon the planet.&nbsp; Yet it is a fact.&nbsp; We
are blinded to it and can hardly believe it, because of the
impotency of our little intellects to conceive a destiny which
shall take care of every atom of life on the globe: we are
compelled to think that in such vast crowds of people as we
behold, individuals must elude the eye of the Maker, and be swept
into forgetfulness.&nbsp; But the truth of truths is that the
mind of the universe is not our mind, or at any rate controlled
by our limitations.</p>
<p>This has been a long digression which I did not intend; but I
could not help it.&nbsp; I was anxious to show how Mrs. Butts met
her trouble through her religion.&nbsp; The apostle says that
&ldquo;<i>they drank of that spiritual Rock which followed
them</i>, <i>and that Rock was Christ</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was
true of her.&nbsp; The way through the desert was not
annihilated; the path remained stony and sore to the feet, but it
was accompanied to the end by a sweet stream to which she could
turn aside, and from which she could obtain refreshment and
strength.</p>
<p>Just about the time that we began our meetings near Drury
Lane, I heard that Clem was dead; that he had died abroad.&nbsp;
I knew nothing more; I thought about him and his wife perhaps for
a day, but I had parted from both long ago, and I went on with my
work.</p>

81</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WHAT IT ALL CAME TO</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> two years or thereabouts,
M&rsquo;Kay and myself continued our labours in the Drury Lane
neighbourhood.&nbsp; There is a proverb that it is the first step
which is the most difficult in the achievement of any object, and
the proverb has been altered by ascribing the main part of the
difficulty to the last step.&nbsp; Neither the first nor the last
has been the difficult step with me, but rather what lies
between.&nbsp; The first is usually helped by the excitement and
the promise of new beginnings, and the last by the prospect of
triumph; but the intermediate path is unassisted by enthusiasm,
and it is here we are so likely to faint.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Kay
nevertheless persevered, supporting me, who otherwise might have
been tempted to despair, and at the end of the two years we were
still at our posts.&nbsp; We had, however, learned
something.&nbsp; We had learned that we could not make the
slightest impression on Drury Lane proper.&nbsp; Now and then an
idler, or sometimes a dozen, lounged in, but what was said was
strange to them; they were out of their own world as completely
as if they were in another planet, and all our efforts to reach
them by simplicity of statement and by talking about things which
we supposed would interest them utterly failed.&nbsp; I did not
know, till I came in actual contact with them, how far away the
classes which lie at the bottom of great cities are from those
above them; how completely they are inaccessible to motives which
act upon ordinary human beings, and how deeply they are sunk
beyond ray of sun or stars, immersed in the selfishness naturally
begotten of their incessant struggle for existence and the
incessant warfare with society.&nbsp; It was an awful thought to
me, ever present on those Sundays, and haunting me at other
times, that men, women, and children were living in such brutish
degradation, and that as they died others would take their
place.&nbsp; Our civilisation seemed nothing but a thin film or
crust lying over a volcanic pit, and I often wondered whether
some day the pit would not break up through it and destroy us
all.&nbsp; Great towns are answerable for the creation and
maintenance of the masses of dark, impenetrable, subterranean
blackguardism, with which we became acquainted.&nbsp; The filthy
gloom of the sky, the dirt of the street, the absence of fresh
air, the herding of the poor into huge districts which cannot be
opened up by those who would do good, are tremendous agencies of
corruption which are active at such a rate that it is appalling
to reflect what our future will be if the accumulation of
population be not checked.&nbsp; To stand face to face with the
insoluble is not pleasant.&nbsp; A man will do anything rather
than confess it is beyond him.&nbsp; He will create pleasant
fictions, and fancy a possible escape here and there, but this
problem of Drury Lane was round and hard like a ball of
adamant.&nbsp; The only thing I could do was faintly, and I was
about to say stupidly, hope&mdash;for I had no rational, tangible
grounds for hoping&mdash;that some force of which we are not now
aware might some day develop itself which will be able to resist
and remove the pressure which sweeps and crushes into a hell,
sealed from the upper air, millions of human souls every year in
one quarter of the globe alone.</p>
<p>M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s dreams therefore were not realised, and
yet it would be a mistake to say that they ended in
nothing.&nbsp; It often happens that a grand attempt, although it
may fail&mdash;miserably fail&mdash;is fruitful in the end and
leaves a result, not the hoped for result it is true, but one
which would never have been attained without it.&nbsp; A youth
strives after the impossible, and he is apt to break his heart
because he has never even touched it, but nevertheless his whole
life is the sweeter for the striving; and the archer who aims at
a mark a hundred yards away will send his arrow further than he
who sets his bow and his arm for fifty yards.&nbsp; So it was
with M&rsquo;Kay.&nbsp; He did not convert Drury Lane, but he
saved two or three.&nbsp; One man whom we came to know was a
labourer in Somerset House, a kind of coal porter employed in
carrying coals into the offices there from the cellars below, and
in other menial duties.&nbsp; He had about fifteen or sixteen
shillings a week, and as the coals must necessarily be in the
different rooms before ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, he began
work early, and was obliged to live within an easy distance of
the Strand.&nbsp; This man had originally been a small tradesman
in a country town.&nbsp; He was honest, but he never could or
never would push his trade in any way.&nbsp; He was fond of all
kinds of little mechanical contrivings, disliked his shop, and
ought to have been a carpenter or cabinet-maker&mdash;not as a
master but as a journeyman, for he had no ability whatever to
control men or direct large operations.&nbsp; He was married, and
a sense of duty to his wife&mdash;he fortunately had no
children&mdash;induced him to stand or sit behind his counter
with regularity, but people would not come to buy of him, because
he never seemed to consider their buying as any favour conferred
on him; and thus he became gradually displaced by his more
energetic or more obsequious rivals.&nbsp; In the end he was
obliged to put up his shutters.&nbsp; Unhappily for him, he had
never been a very ardent attendant at any of the places of
religious worship in the town, and he had therefore no
organisation to help him.&nbsp; Not being master of any craft, he
was in a pitiable plight, and was slowly sinking, when he applied
to the solicitor of the political party for which he had always
voted to assist him.&nbsp; The solicitor applied to the member,
and the member, much regretting the difficulty of obtaining
places for grown-up men, and explaining the pressure upon the
Treasury, wrote to say that the only post at his disposal was
that of labourer.&nbsp; He would have liked to offer a
messengership, but the Treasury had hundreds of applications from
great people who wished to dispose of favourite footmen whose
services they no longer required.&nbsp; Our friend Taylor had by
this time been brought very low, or he would have held out for
something better, but there was nothing to be done.&nbsp; He was
starving, and he therefore accepted; came to London; got a room,
one room only, near Clare Market, and began his new duties.&nbsp;
He was able to pick up a shilling or two more weekly by going on
errands for the clerks during his slack time in the day, so that
altogether on the average he made up about eighteen
shillings.&nbsp; Wandering about the Clare Market region on
Sunday he found us out, came in, and remained constant.&nbsp;
Naturally, as we had so few adherents, we gradually knew these
few very intimately, and Taylor would often spend a holiday or
part of the Sunday with us.&nbsp; He was not eminent for anything
in particular, and an educated man, selecting as his friends
those only who stand for something, would not have taken the
slightest notice of him.&nbsp; He had read nothing particular,
and thought nothing particular&mdash;he was indeed one of the
masses&mdash;but in this respect different, that he had not the
tendency to association, aggregation, or clanship which belong to
the masses generally.&nbsp; He was different, of course, in all
his ways from his neighbours born and bred to Clare Market and
its alleys.&nbsp; Although commonplace, he had demands made upon
him for an endurance by no means commonplace, and he had sorrows
which were as exquisite as those of his betters.&nbsp; He did not
much resent his poverty.&nbsp; To that I think he would have
submitted, and in fact he did submit to it cheerfully.&nbsp; What
rankled in him was the brutal disregard of him at the
office.&nbsp; He was a servant of servants.&nbsp; The messengers,
who themselves were exposed to all the petty tyrannies of the
clerks, and dared not reply, were Taylor&rsquo;s masters, and
sought a compensation for their own serfdom by making his ten
times worse.&nbsp; The head messenger, who had been a butler,
swore at him, and if Taylor had &ldquo;answered&rdquo; he would
have been reported.&nbsp; He had never been a person of much
importance, but at least he had been independent, and it was a
new experience for him to feel that he was a thing fit for
nothing but to be cuffed and cursed.&nbsp; Upon this point he
used to get eloquent&mdash;as eloquent as he could be, for he had
small power of expression, and he would describe to me the
despair which came over him down in those dark vaults at the
prospect of life continuing after this fashion, and with not the
minutest gleam of light even at the very end.&nbsp; Nobody ever
cared to know the most ordinary facts about him.&nbsp; Nobody
inquired whether he was married or single; nobody troubled
himself when he was ill.&nbsp; If he was away, his pay was
stopped; and when he returned to work nobody asked if he was
better.&nbsp; Who can wonder that at first, when he was an utter
stranger in a strange land, he was overcome by the situation, and
that the world was to him a dungeon worse than that of
Chillon?&nbsp; Who can wonder that he was becoming
reckless?&nbsp; A little more of such a life would have
transformed him into a brute.&nbsp; He had not the ability to
become revolutionary, or it would have made him a
conspirator.&nbsp; Suffering of any kind is hard to bear, but the
suffering which especially damages character is that which is
caused by the neglect or oppression of man.&nbsp; At any rate it
was so in Taylor&rsquo;s case.&nbsp; I believe that he would have
been patient under any inevitable ordinance of nature, but he
could not lie still under contempt, the knowledge that to those
about him he was of less consequence than the mud under their
feet.&nbsp; He was timid and, after his failure as a shopkeeper,
and the near approach to the workhouse, he dreaded above
everything being again cast adrift.&nbsp; Strange conflict arose
in him, for the insults to which he was exposed drove him almost
to madness; and yet the dread of dismissal in a moment checked
him when he was about to &ldquo;fire up,&rdquo; as he called it,
and reduced him to a silence which was torture.&nbsp; Once he was
ordered to bring some coals for the messenger&rsquo;s
lobby.&nbsp; The man who gave him the order, finding that he was
a long time bringing them, went to the top of the stairs, and
bawled after him with an oath to make haste.&nbsp; The reason of
the delay was that Taylor had two loads to bring up&mdash;one for
somebody else.&nbsp; When he got to the top of the steps, the
messenger with another oath took the coals, and saying that he
&ldquo;would teach him to skulk there again,&rdquo; kicked the
other coal-scuttle down to the bottom.&nbsp; Taylor himself told
me this; and yet, although he would have rejoiced if the man had
dropped down dead, and would willingly have shot him, he was
dumb.&nbsp; The check operated in an instant.&nbsp; He saw
himself without a penny, and in the streets.&nbsp; He went down
into the cellar, and raged and wept for an hour.&nbsp; Had he
been a workman, he would probably have throttled his enemy, or
tried to do it, or what is more likely, his enemy would not have
dared to treat him in such fashion, but he was powerless, and
once losing his situation he would have sunk down into the
gutter, whence he would have been swept by the parish into the
indiscriminate heap of London pauperism, and carted away to the
Union, a conclusion which was worse to him than being hung.</p>
<p>Another of our friends was a waiter in one of the
public-houses and chop-houses combined, of which there are so
many in the Strand.&nbsp; He lived in a wretched alley which ran
from St. Clement&rsquo;s Church to Boswell Court&mdash;I have
forgotten its name&mdash;a dark crowded passage.&nbsp; He was a
man of about sixty&mdash;invariably called John, without the
addition of any surname.&nbsp; I knew him long before we opened
our room, for I was in the habit of frequently visiting the
chop-house in which he served.&nbsp; His hours were
incredible.&nbsp; He began at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning
with sweeping the dining-room, cleaning the tables and the gas
globes, and at twelve business commenced with early
luncheons.&nbsp; Not till three-quarters of an hour after
midnight could he leave, for the house was much used by persons
who supped there after the theatres.&nbsp; During almost the
whole of this time he was on his legs, and very often he was
unable to find two minutes in the day in which to get his
dinner.&nbsp; Sundays, however, were free.&nbsp; John was not a
head waiter, but merely a subordinate, and I never knew why at
his time of life he had not risen to a better position.&nbsp; He
used to say that &ldquo;things had been against him,&rdquo; and I
had no right to seek for further explanations.&nbsp; He was
married, and had had three children, of whom one only was
living&mdash;a boy of ten years old, whom he hoped to get into
the public-house as a potboy for a beginning.&nbsp; Like Taylor,
the world had well-nigh overpowered John entirely&mdash;crushed
him out of all shape, so that what he was originally, or might
have been, it was almost impossible to tell.&nbsp; There was no
particular character left in him.&nbsp; He may once have been
this or that, but every angle now was knocked off, as it is
knocked off from the rounded pebbles which for ages have been
dragged up and down the beach by the waves.&nbsp; For a lifetime
he had been exposed to all sorts of whims and caprices, generally
speaking of the most unreasonable kind, and he had become so
trained to take everything without remonstrance or murmuring that
every cross in his life came to him as a chop alleged by an
irritated customer to be raw or done to a cinder.&nbsp; Poor
wretch! he had one trouble, however, which he could not accept
with such equanimity, or rather with such indifference.&nbsp; His
wife was a drunkard.&nbsp; This was an awful trial to him.&nbsp;
The worst consequence was that his boy knew that his mother got
drunk.&nbsp; The neighbours kindly enough volunteered to look
after the little man when he was not at school, and they waylaid
him and gave him dinner when his mother was intoxicated; but
frequently he was the first when he returned to find out that
there was nothing for him to eat, and many a time he got up at
night as late as twelve o&rsquo;clock, crawled downstairs, and
went off to his father to tell him that &ldquo;she was very bad,
and he could not go to sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; The father, then, had
to keep his son in the Strand till it was time to close, take him
back, and manage in the best way he could.&nbsp; Over and over
again was he obliged to sit by this wretched woman&rsquo;s
bedside till breakfast time, and then had to go to work as
usual.&nbsp; Let anybody who has seen a case of this kind say
whether the State ought not to provide for the relief of such men
as John, and whether he ought not to have been able to send his
wife away to some institution where she might have been tended
and restrained from destroying, not merely herself, but her
husband and her child.&nbsp; John hardly bore up under this
sorrow.&nbsp; A man may endure much, provided he knows that he
will be well supported when his day&rsquo;s toil is over; but if
the help for which he looks fails, he falls.&nbsp; Oh those weary
days in that dark back dining-room, from which not a square inch
of sky was visible! weary days haunted by a fear that while he
was there unknown mischief was being done! weary days, whose
close nevertheless he dreaded!&nbsp; Beaten down, baffled,
disappointed, if we are in tolerable health we can contrive to
live on some almost impossible chance, some most distant flicker
of hope.&nbsp; It is astonishing how minute a crack in the heavy
uniform cloud will relieve us; but when with all our searching we
can see nothing, then at last we sink.&nbsp; Such was
John&rsquo;s case when I first came to know him.&nbsp; He
attracted me rather, and bit by bit he confided his story to
me.&nbsp; He found out that I might be trusted, and that I could
sympathise, and he told me what he had never told to anybody
before.&nbsp; I was curious to discover whether religion had done
anything for him, and I put the question to him in an indirect
way.&nbsp; His answer was that &ldquo;some on &rsquo;em say
there&rsquo;s a better world where everything will be put right,
but somehow it seemed too good to be true.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was
his reason for disbelief, and heaven had not the slightest effect
on him.&nbsp; He found out the room, and was one of our most
constant friends.</p>
<p>Another friend was of a totally different type.&nbsp; His name
was Cardinal.&nbsp; He was a Yorkshireman, broad-shouldered,
ruddy in the face, short-necked, inclined apparently to apoplexy,
and certainly to passion.&nbsp; He was a commercial traveller in
the cloth trade, and as he had the southern counties for his
district, London was his home when he was not upon his
journeys.&nbsp; His wife was a curious contrast to him.&nbsp; She
was dark-haired, pinched-up, thin-lipped, and always seemed as if
she suffered from some chronic pain or gnawing&mdash;not
sufficient to make her ill, but sufficient to make her
miserable.&nbsp; They had no children.&nbsp; Cardinal in early
life had been a member of an orthodox Dissenting congregation,
but he had fallen away.&nbsp; He had nobody to guide him, and the
position into which he fell was peculiar.&nbsp; He never busied
himself about religion or philosophy; indeed he had had no
training which would have led him to take an interest in abstract
questions, but he read all kinds of romances and poetry without
any order and upon no system.&nbsp; He had no discriminating
faculty, and mixed up together the most heterogeneous mass of
trumpery novels, French translations, and the best English
authors, provided only they were unworldly or sentimental.&nbsp;
Neither did he know how far to take what he read and use it in
his daily life.&nbsp; He often selected some fantastical motive
which he had found set forth as operative in one of his heroes,
and he brought it into his business, much to the astonishment of
his masters and customers.&nbsp; For this reason he was not
stable.&nbsp; He changed employers two or three times; and, so
far as I could make out, his ground of objection to each of the
firms whom he left might have been a ground of dislike in a girl
to a suitor, but certainly nothing more.&nbsp; During the
intervals of his engagements, unless he was pressed for money, he
did nothing&mdash;not from laziness, but because he had got a
notion in his head that his mind wanted rest and
reinvigoration.&nbsp; His habit then was to consume the whole
day&mdash;day after day&mdash;in reading or in walking out by
himself.&nbsp; It may easily be supposed that with a temperament
like his, and with nobody near him to take him by the hand, he
made great mistakes.&nbsp; His wife and he cared nothing for one
another, but she was jealous to the last degree.&nbsp; I never
saw such jealousy.&nbsp; It was strange that, although she almost
hated him, she watched him with feline sharpness and patience,
and would even have killed any woman whom she knew had won his
affection.&nbsp; He, on the other hand, openly avowed that
marriage without love was nothing, and flaunted without the least
modification the most ideal theories as to the relation between
man and woman.&nbsp; Not that he ever went actually wrong.&nbsp;
His boyish education, his natural purity, and a fear never wholly
suppressed, restrained him.&nbsp; He exasperated people by his
impracticability, and it must be acknowledged that it is very
irritating in a difficult complexity demanding the gravest
consideration&mdash;the balancing of this against that&mdash;to
hear a man suddenly propose some naked principle with which
everybody is acquainted, and decide by it solely.&nbsp; I came to
know him through M&rsquo;Kay, who had known him for years; but
M&rsquo;Kay at last broke out against him, and called him a
stupid fool when he threw up a handsome salary and refused to
serve any longer under a house which had always treated him well,
because they, moving with the times, had determined to offer
their customers a cheaper description of goods, which Cardinal
thought was dishonest.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Kay said, and said truly,
that many poor persons would buy these goods who could buy
nothing else, and that Cardinal, before yielding to such
scruples, ought to satisfy himself that, by yielding, he would
not become a burden upon others less fanciful.&nbsp; This was
just what happened.&nbsp; Cardinal could get no work again for a
long time, and had to borrow money.&nbsp; I was sorry; but for my
part, this and other eccentricities did not disturb my confidence
in him.&nbsp; He was an honest, affectionate soul, and his
peculiarities were a necessary result of the total chaos of a
time without any moral guidance.&nbsp; With no church, no
philosophy, no religion, the wonder is that anybody on whom use
and wont relax their hold should ever do anything more than
blindly rove hither and thither, arriving at nothing.&nbsp;
Cardinal was adrift, like thousands and hundreds of thousands of
others, and amidst the storm and pitchy darkness of the night,
thousands and hundreds of thousands of voices offer us
pilotage.&nbsp; It spoke well for him that he did nothing worse
than take a few useless phantoms on board which did him no harm,
and that he held fast to his own instinct for truth and
goodness.&nbsp; I never let myself be annoyed by what he produced
to me from his books.&nbsp; All that I discarded.&nbsp;
Underneath all that was a solid worth which I loved, and which
was mostly not vocal.&nbsp; What was vocal in him was, I am bound
to say, not of much value.</p>
<p>About the time when our room opened, Mrs. Cardinal had become
almost insupportable to her husband.&nbsp; Poor woman; I always
pitied her; she was alone sometimes for a fortnight at a stretch;
she read nothing; there was no child to occupy her thoughts; she
knew that her husband lived in a world into which she never
entered, and she had nothing to do but to brood over imaginary
infidelities.&nbsp; She was literally possessed, and who shall be
hard upon her?&nbsp; Nobody cared for her; everybody with whom
her husband associated disliked her, and she knew perfectly well
they never asked her to their houses except for his sake.&nbsp;
Cardinal vowed at last he would endure her no longer, and that
they must separate.&nbsp; He was induced one Sunday morning, when
his resolution was strong within him, and he was just about to
give effect to it, to come with us.&nbsp; The quiet seemed to
soothe him, and he went home with me afterwards.&nbsp; He was not
slow to disclose to me his miserable condition, and his resolve
to change it.&nbsp; I do not know now what I said, but it
appeared to me that he ought not to change it, and that change
would be for him most perilous.&nbsp; I thought that with a
little care life might become at least bearable with his wife;
that by treating her not so much as if she were criminal, but as
if she were diseased, hatred might pass into pity, and pity into
merciful tenderness to her, and that they might dwell together
upon terms not harder than those upon which many persons who have
made mistakes in youth agree to remain with each other; terms
which, after much consideration, they adjudge it better to accept
than to break loose, and bring upon themselves and those
connected with them all that open rupture involves.&nbsp; The
difficulty was to get Cardinal to give up his theory of what two
abstract human beings should do between whom no love
exists.&nbsp; It seemed to him something like atheism to forsake
his clearly-discerned, simple rule for a course which was
dictated by no easily-grasped higher law, and it was very
difficult to persuade him that there is anything of equal
authority in a law less rigid in its outline.&nbsp; However, he
went home.&nbsp; I called on him some time afterwards, and saw
that a peace, or at any rate a truce, was proclaimed, which
lasted up to the day of his death.&nbsp; M&rsquo;Kay and I agreed
to make as much of Mrs. Cardinal as we could, and yielding to
urgent invitation, she came to the room.&nbsp; This wonderfully
helped to heal her.&nbsp; She began to feel that she was not
overlooked, put on one side, or despised, and the bonds which
bound her constricted lips into bitterness were loosened.</p>
<p>Another friend, and the last whom I shall name, was a young
man named Clark.&nbsp; He was lame, and had been so from
childhood.&nbsp; His father was a tradesman, working hard from
early morning till late at night, and burdened with a number of
children.&nbsp; The boy Richard, shut out from the companionship
of his fellows, had a great love of books.&nbsp; When he left
school his father did not know what to do with him&mdash;in fact
there was only one occupation open to him, and that was clerical
work of one kind or another.&nbsp; At last he got a place in a
house in Fleet Street, which did a large business in those days
in sending newspapers into the country.&nbsp; His whole
occupation all day long was to write addresses, and for this he
received twenty-five shillings a week, his hours being from nine
o&rsquo;clock till seven.&nbsp; The office in which he sat was
crowded, and in order to squeeze the staff into the smallest
space, rent being dear, a gallery had been run round the wall
about four feet from the ceiling.&nbsp; This was provided with
desks and gas lamps, and up there Clark sat, artificial light
being necessary four days out of five.&nbsp; He came straight
from the town in which his father lived to Fleet Street, and once
settled in it there seemed no chance of change for the
better.&nbsp; He knew what his father&rsquo;s struggles were; he
could not go back to him, and he had not the energy to attempt to
lift himself.&nbsp; It is very doubtful too whether he could have
succeeded in achieving any improvement, whatever his energy might
have been.&nbsp; He had got lodgings in Newcastle Street, and to
these he returned in the evening, remaining there alone with his
little library, and seldom moving out of doors.&nbsp; He was
unhealthy constitutionally, and his habits contributed to make
him more so.&nbsp; Everything which he saw which was good seemed
only to sharpen the contrast between himself and his lot, and his
reading was a curse to him rather than a blessing.&nbsp; I
sometimes wished that he had never inherited any love whatever
for what is usually considered to be the Best, and that he had
been endowed with an organisation coarse and commonplace, like
that of his colleagues.&nbsp; If he went into company which
suited him, or read anything which interested him, it seemed as
if the ten hours of the gallery in Fleet Street had been made
thereby only the more insupportable, and his habitual mood was
one of despondency, so that his fellow clerks who knew his tastes
not unnaturally asked what was the use of them if they only made
him wretched; and they were more than ever convinced that in
their amusements lay true happiness.&nbsp; Habit, which is the
saviour of most of us, the opiate which dulls the otherwise
unbearable miseries of life, only served to make Clark more
sensitive.&nbsp; The monotony of that perpetual address-copying
was terrible.&nbsp; He has told me with a kind of shame what an
effect it had upon him&mdash;that sometimes for days he would
feed upon the prospect of the most childish trifle because it
would break in some slight degree the uniformity of his
toil.&nbsp; For example, he would sometimes change from quill to
steel pens and back again, and he found himself actually looking
forward with a kind of joy&mdash;merely because of the
variation&mdash;to the day on which he had fixed to go back to
the quill after using steel.&nbsp; He would determine, two or
three days beforehand, to get up earlier, and to walk to Fleet
Street by way of Great Queen Street and Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
Fields, and upon this he would subsist till the day came.&nbsp;
He could make no longer excursions because of his lameness.&nbsp;
All this may sound very much like simple silliness to most
people, but those who have not been bound to a wheel do not know
what thoughts come into the head of the strongest man who is
extended on it.&nbsp; Clark sat side by side in his gallery with
other young men of rather a degraded type, and the confinement
bred in them a filthy grossness with which they tormented
him.&nbsp; They excited in him loathsome images, from which he
could not free himself either by day or night.&nbsp; He was
peculiarly weak in his inability to cast off impressions, or to
get rid of mental pictures when once formed, and his distress at
being haunted by these hateful, disgusting thoughts was
pitiable.&nbsp; They were in fact almost more than thoughts, they
were transportations out of himself&mdash;real visions.&nbsp; It
would have been his salvation if he could have been a carpenter
or a bricklayer, in country air, but this could not be.</p>
<p>Clark had no power to think connectedly to a conclusion.&nbsp;
When an idea came into his head, he dwelt upon it incessantly,
and no correction of the false path upon which it set him was
possible, because he avoided society.&nbsp; Work over, he was so
sick of people that he went back to himself.&nbsp; So it came to
pass that when brought into company, what he believed and
cherished was frequently found to be open to obvious objection,
and was often nothing better than nonsense which was rudely, and
as he himself was forced to admit, justly overthrown.&nbsp; He
ought to have been surrounded with intelligent friends, who would
have enabled him to see continually the other side, and who would
have prevented his long and useless wanderings.&nbsp; Like many
other persons, too, whom I have known&mdash;just in proportion to
his lack of penetrative power was his tendency to occupy himself
with difficult questions.&nbsp; By a cruel destiny he was
impelled to dabble in matters for which he was totally
unfitted.&nbsp; He never could go beyond his author a single
step, and he lost himself in endless mazes.&nbsp; If he could but
have been persuaded to content himself with sweet presentations
of wholesome happy existence, with stories and with history, how
much better it would have been for him!&nbsp; He had had no
proper training whatever for anything more, he was ignorant of
the exact meaning of the proper terminology of science, and an
unlucky day it was for him when he picked up on a bookstall some
very early translation of some German book on philosophy.&nbsp;
One reason, as may be conjectured, for his mistakes was his
education in dissenting Calvinism, a religion which is entirely
metaphysical, and encourages, unhappily, in everybody a taste for
tremendous problems.&nbsp; So long as Calvinism is unshaken, the
mischief is often not obvious, because a ready solution taken on
trust is provided; but when doubts arise, the evil results become
apparent, and the poor helpless victim, totally at a loss, is
torn first in this direction and then in the other, and cannot
let these questions alone.&nbsp; He has been taught to believe
they are connected with salvation, and he is compelled still to
busy himself with them, rather than with simple external
piety.</p>

103</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DRURY LANE THEOLOGY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> were some of our
disciples.&nbsp; I do not think that church or chapel would have
done them much good.&nbsp; Preachers are like unskilled doctors
with the same pill and draught for every complaint.&nbsp; They do
not know where the fatal spot lies on lung or heart or nerve
which robs us of life.&nbsp; If any of these persons just
described had gone to church or chapel they would have heard
discourses on the usual set topics, none of which would have
concerned them.&nbsp; Their trouble was not the forgiveness of
sins, the fallacies of Arianism, the personality of the Holy
Ghost, or the doctrine of the Eucharist.&nbsp; They all
<i>wanted</i> something distinctly.&nbsp; They had great gaping
needs which they longed to satisfy, intensely practical and
special.&nbsp; Some of these necessities no words could in any
way meet.&nbsp; It was obvious, for instance, that Clark must at
once be taken away from his gallery and his copying if he was to
live&mdash;at least in sanity.&nbsp; He had fortunately learned
shorthand, and M&rsquo;Kay got him employment on a
newspaper.&nbsp; His knowledge of his art was by no means perfect
at first, but he was sent to attend meetings where
<i>verbatim</i> reports were not necessary, and he quickly
advanced.&nbsp; Taylor, too, we tried to remove, and we succeeded
in attaching him to a large club as an out-of-doors porter.&nbsp;
The poor man was now at least in the open air, and freed from
insolent tyranny.&nbsp; This, however, was help such as anybody
might have given.&nbsp; The question of most importance is, What
gospel had we to give?&nbsp; Why, in short, did we meet on the
Sunday?&nbsp; What was our justification?&nbsp; In the first
place, there was the simple quietude.&nbsp; The retreat from the
streets and from miserable cares into a place where there was
peace and room for reflection was something.&nbsp; It is all very
well for cultivated persons with libraries to scoff at religious
services.&nbsp; To the poor the cathedral or the church might be
an immense benefit, if only for the reason that they present a
barrier to worldly noise, and are a distinct invitation by
architecture and symbolic decoration to meditation on something
beyond the business which presses on them during the week.&nbsp;
Poor people frequently cannot read for want of a place in which
to read.&nbsp; Moreover, they require to be provoked by a
stronger stimulus than that of a book.&nbsp; They willingly hear
a man talk if he has anything to say, when they would not care to
look at what he said if it were printed.&nbsp; But to come more
closely to the point.&nbsp; Our main object was to create in our
hearers contentment with their lot; and even some joy in
it.&nbsp; That was our religion; that was the central thought of
all we said and did, giving shape and tendency to
everything.&nbsp; We admitted nothing which did not help us in
that direction, and everything which did help us.&nbsp; Our
attempts, to any one who had not the key, may have seemed vague
and desultory.&nbsp; We might by a stranger have been accused of
feeble wandering, of idle dabbling, now in this subject and now
in that, but after a while he would have found that though we
were weak creatures, with no pretence to special knowledge in any
subject, we at least knew what we meant, and tried to accomplish
it.&nbsp; For my own part, I was happy when I had struck that
path.&nbsp; I felt as if somehow, after many errors, I had once
more gained a road, a religion in fact, and one which essentially
was not new but old, the religion of the Reconciliation, the
reconciliation of man with God; differing from the current creed
in so far as I did not lay stress upon sin as the cause of
estrangement, but yet agreeing with it in making it my duty of
duties to suppress revolt, and to submit calmly and sometimes
cheerfully to the Creator.&nbsp; This surely, under a thousand
disguises, has been the meaning of all the forms of worship which
we have seen in the world.&nbsp; Pain and death are nothing new,
and men have been driven into perplexed scepticism, and even
insurrection by them, ever since men came into being.&nbsp;
Always, however, have the majority, the vast majority of the
race, felt instinctively that in this scepticism and insurrection
they could not abide, and they have struggled more or less
blindly after explanation; determined not to desist till they had
found it, and reaching a result embodied in a multitude of shapes
irrational and absurd to the superficial scoffer, but of profound
interest to the thoughtful.&nbsp; I may observe, in passing, that
this is a reason why all great religions should be treated with
respect, and in a certain sense preserved.&nbsp; It is nothing
less than a wicked waste of accumulated human strivings to sneer
them out of existence.&nbsp; They will be found, every one of
them, to have incarnated certain vital doctrines which it has
cost centuries of toil and devotion properly to appreciate.&nbsp;
Especially is this true of the Catholic faith, and if it were
worth while, it might be shown how it is nothing less than a
divine casket of precious remedies, and if it is to be brutally
broken, it will take ages to rediscover and restore them.&nbsp;
Of one thing I am certain, that their rediscovery and restoration
will be necessary.&nbsp; I cannot too earnestly insist upon the
need of our holding, each man for himself, by some faith which
shall anchor him.&nbsp; It must not be taken up by chance.&nbsp;
We must fight for it, for only so will it become <i>our</i>
faith.&nbsp; The halt in indifference or in hostility is easy
enough and seductive enough.&nbsp; The half-hearted thinks that
when he has attained that stage he has completed the term of
human wisdom.&nbsp; I say go on: do not stay there; do not take
it for granted that there is nothing beyond; incessantly attempt
an advance, and at last a light, dim it may be, will arise.&nbsp;
It will not be a completed system, perfect in all points, an
answer to all our questions, but at least it will give ground for
hope.</p>
<p>We had to face the trials of our friends, and we had to face
death.&nbsp; I do not say for an instant that we had any
effectual reply to these great arguments against us.&nbsp; We
never so much as sought for one, knowing how all men had sought
and failed.&nbsp; But we were able to say there is some
compensation, that there is another side, and this is all that
man can say.&nbsp; No theory of the world is possible.&nbsp; The
storm, the rain slowly rotting the harvest, children sickening in
cellars are obvious; but equally obvious are an evening in June,
the delight of men and women in one another, in music, and in the
exercise of thought.&nbsp; There can surely be no question that
the sum of satisfaction is increasing, not merely in the gross
but for each human being, as the earth from which we sprang is
being worked out of the race, and a higher type is being
developed.&nbsp; I may observe, too, that although it is usually
supposed, it is erroneously supposed, that it is pure doubt which
disturbs or depresses us.&nbsp; Simple suspense is in fact very
rare, for there are few persons so constituted as to be able to
remain in it.&nbsp; It is dogmatism under the cloak of doubt
which pulls us down.&nbsp; It is the dogmatism of death, for
example, which we have to avoid.&nbsp; The open grave is
dogmatic, and we say <i>that man has gone</i>, but this is as
much a transgression of the limits of certitude as if we were to
say <i>he is an angel in bliss</i>.&nbsp; The proper attitude,
the attitude enjoined by the severest exercise of the reason is,
<i>I do not know</i>; and in this there is an element of hope,
now rising and now falling, but always sufficient to prevent that
blank despair which we must feel if we consider it as settled
that when we lie down under the grass there is an absolute
end.</p>
<p>The provision in nature of infinity ever present to us is an
immense help.&nbsp; No man can look up to the stars at night and
reflect upon what lies behind them without feeling that the
tyranny of the senses is loosened, and the tyranny, too, of the
conclusions of his logic.&nbsp; The beyond and the beyond, let us
turn it over as we may, let us consider it as a child considers
it, or by the light of the newest philosophy, is a constant,
visible warning not to make our minds the measure of the
universe.&nbsp; Underneath the stars what dreams, what
conjectures arise, shadowy enough, it is true; but one thing we
cannot help believing as irresistibly as if by geometrical
deduction&mdash;that the sphere of that understanding of ours,
whose function it seems to be to imprison us, is limited.</p>
<p>Going through a churchyard one afternoon I noticed that nearly
all the people who were buried there, if the inscriptions on the
tombstones might be taken to represent the thoughts of the
departed when they were alive, had been intent solely on their
own personal salvation.&nbsp; The question with them all seemed
to have been, shall <i>I</i> go to heaven?&nbsp; Considering the
tremendous difference between heaven and hell in the popular
imagination, it was very natural that these poor creatures should
be anxious above everything to know whether they would be in hell
or heaven for ever.&nbsp; Surely, however, this is not the
highest frame of mind, nor is it one to be encouraged.&nbsp; I
would rather do all I can to get out of it, and to draw others
out of it too.&nbsp; Our aim ought not so much to be the
salvation of this poor petty self, but of that in me which alone
makes it worth while to save me; of that alone which I hope will
be saved, immortal truth.&nbsp; The very centre of the existence
of the ordinary chapel-goer and church-goer needs to be shifted
from self to what is outside self, and yet is truly self, and the
sole truth of self.&nbsp; If the truth lives, <i>we</i> live, and
if it dies, we are dead.&nbsp; Our theology stands in need of a
reformation greater than that of Luther&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It may be
said that the attempt to replace the care for self in us by a
care for the universal is ridiculous.&nbsp; Man cannot rise to
that height.&nbsp; I do not believe it.&nbsp; I believe we can
rise to it.&nbsp; Every ordinary unselfish act is a proof of the
capacity to rise to it; and the mother&rsquo;s denial of all care
for her own happiness, if she can but make her child happy, is a
sublime anticipation.&nbsp; It may be called an instinct, but in
the course of time it will be possible to develop a wider
instinct in us, so that our love for the truth shall be even
maternally passionate and self-forgetting.</p>
<p>After all our searching it was difficult to find anything
which, in the case of a man like John the waiter, for example,
could be of any service to him.&nbsp; At his age efficient help
was beyond us, and in his case the problem presented itself in
its simple nakedness.&nbsp; What comfort is there discoverable
for the wretched which is not based upon illusion?&nbsp; We could
not tell him that all he endured was right and proper.&nbsp; But
even to him we were able to offer something.&nbsp; We did all we
could to soothe him.&nbsp; On the Sunday, at least, he was able
to find some relief from his labours, and he entered into a
different region.&nbsp; He came to see us in the afternoon and
evening occasionally, and brought his boy.&nbsp; Father and son
were pulled up out of the vault, brought into the daylight, and
led into an open expanse.&nbsp; We tried above everything to
interest them, even in the smallest degree, in what is universal
and impersonal, feeling that in that direction lies
healing.&nbsp; We explained to the child as well as we could some
morsels of science, and in explaining to him we explained to the
father as well.&nbsp; When the anguish begotten by some outbreak
on the part of the wife more violent than usual became almost too
much to bear, we did our best to counsel, and as a last
consolation we could point to Death, divine Death, and
repose.&nbsp; It was but for a few more years at the utmost, and
then must come a rest which no sorrow could invade.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Having death as an ally, I do not tremble at
shadows,&rdquo; is an immortal quotation from some unknown Greek
author.&nbsp; Providence, too, by no miracle, came to our
relief.&nbsp; The wife died, as it was foreseen she must, and
that weight being removed, some elasticity and recoil developed
itself.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s one thought now was for his child, and
by means of the child the father passed out of himself, and
connected himself with the future.&nbsp; The child did in fact
teach the father exactly what we tried to teach, and taught it
with a power of conviction which never could have been produced
by any mere appeals to the reason.&nbsp; The father felt that he
was battered, useless, and a failure, but that in the boy there
were unknown possibilities, and that he might in after life say
that it was to this battered, useless failure of a father he owed
his success.&nbsp; There was nothing now that he would not do to
help Tom&rsquo;s education, and we joyfully aided as best we
could.&nbsp; So, partly I believe by us, but far more by nature
herself, John&rsquo;s salvation was wrought out at least in a
measure; discord by the intervention of another note resolved
itself into a kind of harmony, and even through the skylight in
the Strand a glimpse of the azure was obtained.</p>
<p>I hope my readers, if I should ever have any, will remember
that what I wish to do is to give some account of the manner in
which we sought to be of service to the small and very humble
circle of persons whom we had collected about us.&nbsp; I have
preserved no record of anything; I am merely putting down what
now comes into my mind&mdash;the two or three articles, not
thirty-nine, nor, alas! a third of that number&mdash;which we
were able to hold.&nbsp; I recollect one or two more which
perhaps are worth preservation.&nbsp; In my younger days the aim
of theologians was the justification of the ways of God to
man.&nbsp; They could not succeed.&nbsp; They succeeded no better
than ourselves in satisfying the intellect with a system.&nbsp;
Nor does the Christian religion profess any such
satisfaction.&nbsp; It teaches rather the great doctrine of a
Remedy, of a Mediator; and therein it is profoundly true.&nbsp;
It is unphilosophical in the sense that it offers no explanation
from a single principle, and leaves the ultimate mystery as dark
as before, but it is in accordance with our intuitions.&nbsp;
Everywhere in nature we see exaction of penalties down to the
uttermost farthing, but following after this we discern
forgiveness, obliterating and restorative.&nbsp; Both tendencies
exist.&nbsp; Nature is Rhadamanthine, and more so, for she visits
the sins of the fathers upon the children; but there is in her
also an infinite Pity, healing all wounds, softening all
calamities, ever hastening to alleviate and repair.&nbsp;
Christianity in strange historical fashion is an expression of
nature, a projection of her into a biography and a creed.</p>
<p>We endeavoured to follow Christianity in the depth of its
distinction between right and wrong.&nbsp; Herein this religion
is of priceless value.&nbsp; Philosophy proclaims the unity of
our nature.&nbsp; To philosophy every passion is as natural as
every act of saintlike negation, and one of the usual effects of
thinking or philosophising is to bring together all that is
apparently contrary in man, and to show how it proceeds really
from one centre.&nbsp; But Christianity had not to propound a
theory of man; it had to redeem the world.&nbsp; It laid awful
stress on the duality in us, and the stress laid on that duality
is the world&rsquo;s salvation.&nbsp; The words right and wrong
are not felt now as they were felt by Paul.&nbsp; They shade off
one into the other.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if mankind is not to be
lost, the ancient antagonism must be maintained.&nbsp; The
shallowest of mortals is able now to laugh at the notion of a
personal devil.&nbsp; No doubt there is no such thing existent;
but the horror at evil which could find no other expression than
in the creation of a devil is no subject for laughter, and if it
do not in some shape or other survive, the race itself will not
survive.&nbsp; No religion, so far as I know, has dwelt like
Christianity with such profound earnestness on the bisection of
man&mdash;on the distinction within him, vital to the very last
degree, between the higher and the lower, heaven and hell.&nbsp;
What utter folly is it because of an antique vesture to condemn
as effete what the vesture clothes!&nbsp; Its doctrine and its
sacred story are fixtures in concrete form of precious thoughts
purchased by blood and tears.</p>
<p>I fancy I see the sneer of theologians and critics at our
efforts.&nbsp; The theologians will mock us because we had
nothing better to say.&nbsp; I can only reply that we did our
best.&nbsp; We said all we knew, and we would most thankfully
have said more, had we been sure that it must be true.&nbsp; I
would remind, too, those of our judges who think that we were
such wretched mortals, blind leaders of the blind, that there
have been long ages during which men never pretended to
understand more than we professed to understand.&nbsp; To say
nothing of the Jews, whose meagre system would certainly not have
been thought either satisfying or orthodox by modern Christians,
the Greeks and Romans lived in no clearer light than that which
shines on me.&nbsp; The critics, too, will condemn because of our
weakness; but this defect I at once concede.&nbsp; The severest
critic could not possibly be so severe as I am upon myself.&nbsp;
I <i>know</i> my failings.&nbsp; He, probably, would miss many of
them.&nbsp; But, again I urge that men are not to be debarred by
reason of weakness from doing what little good may lie within
reach of their hands.&nbsp; Had we attempted to save scholars and
thinkers we should have deserved the ridicule with which no doubt
we shall be visited.&nbsp; We aspired to save nobody.&nbsp; We
knew no salvation ourselves.&nbsp; We ventured humbly to bring a
feeble ray of light into the dwellings of two or three poor men
and women; and if Prometheus, fettered to his rock, dwelt with
pride on the blind hopes which he had caused to visit mortals,
the hopes which &ldquo;stopped the continued anticipation of
their destiny,&rdquo; we perhaps may be pardoned if at times we
thought that what we were doing was not altogether vanity.</p>

116</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">QUI DEDIT IN MARI VIAM</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> time to time I received a
newspaper from my native town, and one morning, looking over the
advertisements, I caught sight of one which arrested me.&nbsp; It
was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Widow Lady desires a situation as Daily
Governess to little children.&nbsp; Address E. B., care of Mrs.
George Andrews, Fancy Bazaar, High Street.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. George Andrews was a cousin of Ellen Butts, and that this
was her advertisement I had not the slightest doubt.&nbsp;
Suddenly, without being able to give the least reason for it, an
unconquerable desire to see her arose within me.&nbsp; I could
not understand it.&nbsp; I recollected that memorable resolution
after Miss Arbour&rsquo;s story years ago.&nbsp; How true that
counsel of Miss Arbour&rsquo;s was! and yet it had the defect of
most counsel.&nbsp; It was but a principle; whether it suited
this particular case was the one important point on which Miss
Arbour was no authority.&nbsp; What <i>was</i> it which prompted
this inexplicable emotion?&nbsp; A thousand things rushed through
my head without reason or order.&nbsp; I begin to believe that a
first love never dies.&nbsp; A boy falls in love at eighteen or
nineteen.&nbsp; The attachment comes to nothing.&nbsp; It is
broken off for a multitude of reasons, and he sees its
absurdity.&nbsp; He marries afterwards some other woman whom he
even adores, and he has children for whom he spends his life; yet
in an obscure corner of his soul he preserves everlastingly the
cherished picture of the girl who first was dear to him.&nbsp;
She, too, marries.&nbsp; In process of time she is fifty years
old, and he is fifty-two.&nbsp; He has not seen her for thirty
years or more, but he continually turns aside into the little
oratory, to gaze upon the face as it last appeared to him when he
left her at her gate and saw her no more.&nbsp; He inquires now
and then timidly about her whenever he gets the chance.&nbsp; And
once in his life he goes down to the town where she lives, solely
in order to get a sight of her without her knowing anything about
it.&nbsp; He does not succeed, and he comes back and tells his
wife, from whom he never conceals any secrets, that he has been
away on business.&nbsp; I did not for a moment confess that my
love for Ellen had returned.&nbsp; I knew who she was and what
she was, and what had led to our separation; but nevertheless,
all this obstinately remained in the background, and all the
passages of love between us, all our kisses, and above
everything, her tears at that parting in her father&rsquo;s
house, thrust themselves upon me.&nbsp; It was a mystery to
me.&nbsp; What should have induced that utterly unexpected
resurrection of what I believed to be dead and buried, is beyond
my comprehension.&nbsp; However, the fact remains.&nbsp; I did
not to myself admit that this was love, but it <i>was</i> love,
and that it should have shot up with such swift vitality merely
because I had happened to see those initials was
miraculous.&nbsp; I pretended to myself that I should like once
more to see Mrs. Butts&mdash;perhaps she might be in want and I
could help her.&nbsp; I shrank from writing to her or from making
myself known to her, and at last I hit upon the expedient of
answering her advertisement in a feigned name, and requesting her
to call at the King&rsquo;s Arms hotel upon a gentleman who
wished to engage a widow lady to teach his children.&nbsp; To
prevent any previous inquiries on her part, I said that my name
was Williams, that I lived in the country at some little distance
from the town, but that I should be there on business on the day
named.&nbsp; I took up my quarters at the King&rsquo;s Arms the
night before.&nbsp; It seemed very strange to be in an inn in the
place in which I was born.&nbsp; I retired early to my bedroom,
and looked out in the clear moonlight over the river.&nbsp; The
landscape seemed haunted by ghosts of my former self.&nbsp; At
one particular point, so well known, I stood fishing.&nbsp; At
another, equally well known, where the water was dangerously
deep, I was examining the ice; and round the corner was the
boathouse where we kept the little craft in which I had voyaged
so many hundreds of miles on excursions upwards beyond where the
navigation ends, or, still more fascinating, down to where the
water widens and sails are to be seen, and there is a foretaste
of the distant sea.&nbsp; It is no pleasure to me to revisit
scenes in which earlier days have been passed.&nbsp; I detest the
sentimental melancholy which steals over me; the sense of the
lapse of time, and the reflection that so many whom I knew are
dead.&nbsp; I would always, if possible, spend my holiday in some
new scene, fresh to me, and full of new interest.&nbsp; I slept
but little, and when the morning came, instead of carrying out my
purpose of wandering through the streets, I was so sick of the
mood by which I had been helplessly overcome, that I sat at a
distance from the window in the coffee-room, and read diligently
last week&rsquo;s <i>Bell&rsquo;s Weekly Messenger</i>.&nbsp; My
reading, however, was nothing.&nbsp; I do not suppose I
comprehended the simplest paragraph.&nbsp; My thoughts were away,
and I watched the clock slowly turning towards the hour when
Ellen was to call.&nbsp; I foresaw that I should not be able to
speak to her at the inn.&nbsp; If I have anything particular to
say to anybody, I can always say it so much better out of
doors.&nbsp; I dreaded the confinement of the room, and the
necessity for looking into her face.&nbsp; Under the sky, and in
motion, I should be more at liberty.&nbsp; At last eleven struck
from the church in the square, and five minutes afterwards the
waiter entered to announce Mrs. Butts.&nbsp; I was therefore
right, and she was &ldquo;E. B.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was sure that I
should not be recognised.&nbsp; Since I saw her last I had grown
a beard, my hair had got a little grey, and she was always a
little short-sighted.&nbsp; She came in, and as she entered she
put away over her bonnet her thick black veil.&nbsp; Not ten
seconds passed before she was seated on the opposite side of the
table to that on which I was sitting, but I re-read in her during
those ten seconds the whole history of years.&nbsp; I cannot say
that externally she looked worn or broken.&nbsp; I had imagined
that I should see her undone with her great troubles, but to some
extent, and yet not altogether, I was mistaken.&nbsp; The
cheek-bones were more prominent than of old, and her dark-brown
hair drawn tightly over her forehead increased the clear paleness
of the face; the just perceptible tint of colour which I
recollect being now altogether withdrawn.&nbsp; But she was not
haggard, and evidently not vanquished.&nbsp; There was even a
gaiety on her face, perhaps a trifle enforced, and although the
darkness of sorrow gleamed behind it, the sorrow did not seem to
be ultimate, but to be in front of a final background, if not of
joy, at least of resignation.&nbsp; Her ancient levity of manner
had vanished, or at most had left nothing but a trace.&nbsp; I
thought I detected it here and there in a line about the mouth,
and perhaps in her walk.&nbsp; There was a reminiscence of it too
in her clothes.&nbsp; Notwithstanding poverty and distress, the
old neatness&mdash;that particular care which used to charm me so
when I was little more than a child, was there still.&nbsp; I was
always susceptible to this virtue, and delicate hands and feet,
with delicate care bestowed thereon, were more attractive to me
than slovenly beauty.&nbsp; I noticed that the gloves, though
mended, fitted with the same precision, and that her dress was
unwrinkled and perfectly graceful.&nbsp; Whatever she might have
had to endure, it had not destroyed that self-centred
satisfaction which makes life tolerable.</p>
<p>I was impelled at once to say that I had to beg her pardon for
asking her there.&nbsp; Unfortunately I was obliged to go over to
Cowston, a village which was about three miles from the
town.&nbsp; Perhaps she would not mind walking part of the way
with me through the meadows, and then we could talk with more
freedom, as I should not feel pressed for time.&nbsp; To this
arrangement she at once agreed, and dropping her thick veil over
her face, we went out.&nbsp; In a few minutes we were clear of
the houses, and I began the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been in the habit of teaching?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; The necessity for taking to it has only
lately arisen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you teach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much beyond what children of ten or eleven years
old are expected to know; but I could take charge of them
entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any children of your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you take a situation as resident teacher if you
have a child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get something to do, and if I can make no
arrangement by which my child can live with me, I shall try and
place her with a friend.&nbsp; I may be able to hear of some
appointment as a daily governess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought that in your native town you
would have been easily able to find employment&mdash;you must be
well known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, and after a moment or so she
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were well known once, but we went abroad and lost
all our money.&nbsp; My husband died abroad.&nbsp; When I
returned, I found that there was very little which my friends
could do for me.&nbsp; I am not accomplished, and there are
crowds of young women who are more capable than I am.&nbsp;
Moreover, I saw that I was becoming a burden, and people called
on me rather as a matter of duty than for any other reason.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t know how soon all but the very best insensibly
neglect very poor relatives if they are not gifted or
attractive.&nbsp; I do not wonder at being made to feel this, nor
do I blame anybody.&nbsp; My little girl is a cripple, my rooms
are dull, and I have nothing in me with which to amuse or
entertain visitors.&nbsp; Pardon my going into this detail.&nbsp;
It was necessary to say something in order to explain my
position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask what salary you will require if you live in
the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five-and-thirty pounds a year, but I might take less if
I were asked to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a member of the Church of England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what religious body do you belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am an Independent, but I would go to Church if my
employers wished it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the Independents objected to go to
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do; but I should not object, if I could hear
anything at the Church which would help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rather surprised at your indifference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was once more particular, but I have seen much
suffering, and some things which were important to me are not so
now, and others which were not important have become
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then made up a little story.&nbsp; My sister and I lived
together.&nbsp; We were about to take up our abode at Cowston,
but were as yet strangers to it.&nbsp; I was left a widower with
two little children whom my sister could not educate, as she
could not spare the time.&nbsp; She would naturally have selected
the governess herself, but she was at some distance.&nbsp; She
would like to see Mrs. Butts before engaging her finally, but she
thought that as this advertisement presented itself, I might make
some preliminary inquiries.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, now that Mrs.
Butts knew the facts, she would object to living in the
house.&nbsp; I put it in this way, feeling sure that she would
catch my meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that this situation will not suit me.&nbsp;
I could not go backwards and forwards so far every
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you perfectly, and feared that this would
be your decision.&nbsp; But if you hesitate, I can give you the
best of references.&nbsp; I had not thought of that before.&nbsp;
References of course will be required by you as well as by
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put my hand in my pocket for my pocket-book, but I could not
find it.&nbsp; We had now reached a part of our road familiar
enough to both of us.&nbsp; Along that very path Ellen and I had
walked years ago.&nbsp; Under those very trees, on that very seat
had we sat, and she and I were there again.&nbsp; All the old
confidences, confessions, tendernesses, rushed upon me.&nbsp;
What is there which is more potent than the recollection of past
love to move us to love, and knit love with closest bonds?&nbsp;
Can we ever cease to love the souls who have once shared all that
we know and feel?&nbsp; Can we ever be indifferent to those who
have our secrets, and whose secrets we hold?&nbsp; As I looked at
her, I remembered what she knew about me, and what I knew about
her, and this simple thought so overmastered me, that I could
hold out no longer.&nbsp; I said to her that if she would like to
rest for one moment, I might be able to find my papers.&nbsp; We
sat down together, and she drew up her veil to read the address
which I was about to give her.&nbsp; She glanced at me, as I
thought, with a strange expression of excited interrogation, and
something swiftly passed across her face, which warned me that I
had not a moment to lose.&nbsp; I took out one of my own cards,
handed it to her, and said, &ldquo;Here is a reference which
perhaps you may know.&rdquo;&nbsp; She bent over it, turned to
me, fixed her eyes intently and directly on mine for one moment,
and then I thought she would have fallen.&nbsp; My arm was around
her in an instant, her head was on my shoulder, and my many
wanderings were over.&nbsp; It was broad, high, sunny noon, the
most solitary hour of the daylight in those fields.&nbsp; We were
roused by the distant sound of the town clock striking twelve; we
rose and went on together to Cowston by the river bank, returning
late in the evening.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">FLAGELLUM NON APPROQUINABIT TABERNACULO
TUO</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">suppose</span> that the reason why in
novels the story ends with a marriage is partly that the
excitement of the tale ceases then, and partly also because of a
theory that marriage is an epoch, determining the career of life
after it.&nbsp; The epoch once announced, nothing more need be
explained; everything else follows as a matter of course.&nbsp;
These notes of mine are autobiographical, and not a
romance.&nbsp; I have never known much about epochs.&nbsp; I have
had one or two, one specially when I first began to read and
think; but after that, if I have changed, it has been slowly and
imperceptibly.&nbsp; My life, therefore, is totally unfitted to
be the basis of fiction.&nbsp; My return to Ellen, and our
subsequent marriage, were only partially an epoch.&nbsp; A change
had come, but it was one which had long been preparing.&nbsp;
Ellen&rsquo;s experiences had altered her position, and mine too
was altered.&nbsp; She had been driven into religion by trouble,
and knowing nothing of criticism or philosophy, retained the old
forms for her religious feeling.&nbsp; But the very quickness of
her emotion caused her to welcome all new and living modes of
expressing it.&nbsp; It is only when feeling has ceased to
accompany a creed that it becomes fixed, and verbal departures
from it are counted heresy.&nbsp; I too cared less for argument,
and it even gave me pleasure to talk in her dialect, so familiar
to me, but for so many years unused.</p>
<p>It was now necessary for me to add to my income.&nbsp; I had
nothing upon which to depend save my newspaper, which was
obviously insufficient.&nbsp; At last, I succeeded in obtaining
some clerical employment.&nbsp; For no other work was I fit, for
my training had not been special in any one direction.&nbsp; My
hours were long, from ten in the morning till seven in the
evening, and as I was three miles distant from the office, I was
really away from home for eleven hours every day, excepting on
Sundays.&nbsp; I began to calculate that my life consisted of
nothing but the brief spaces allowed to me for rest, and these
brief spaces I could not enjoy because I dwelt upon their
brevity.&nbsp; There was some excuse for me.&nbsp; Never could
there be any duty incumbent upon man much more inhuman and devoid
of interest than my own.&nbsp; How often I thought about my
friend Clark, and his experiences became mine.&nbsp; The whole
day I did nothing but write, and what I wrote called forth no
single faculty of the mind.&nbsp; Nobody who has not tried such
an occupation can possibly forecast the strange habits, humours,
fancies, and diseases which after a time it breeds.&nbsp; I was
shut up in a room half below the ground.&nbsp; In this room were
three other men besides myself, two of them between fifty and
sixty, and one about three or four-and-twenty.&nbsp; All four of
us kept books or copied letters from ten to seven, with an
interval of three-quarters of an hour for dinner.&nbsp; In all
three of these men, as in the case of Clark&rsquo;s companions,
there had been developed, partly I suppose by the circumstance of
enforced idleness of brain, the most loathsome tendency to
obscenity.&nbsp; This was the one subject which was common
ground, and upon which they could talk.&nbsp; It was fostered too
by a passion for beer, which was supplied by the publican across
the way, who was perpetually travelling to and fro with
cans.&nbsp; My horror when I first found out into what society I
was thrust was unspeakable.&nbsp; There was a clock within a
hundred yards of my window which struck the hours and
quarters.&nbsp; How I watched that clock!&nbsp; My spirits rose
or fell with each division of the day.&nbsp; From ten to twelve
there was nothing but gloom.&nbsp; By half-past twelve I began to
discern dinner time, and the prospect was brighter.&nbsp; After
dinner there was nothing to be done but doggedly to endure until
five, and at five I was able to see over the distance from five
to seven.&nbsp; My disgust at my companions, however, came to be
mixed with pity.&nbsp; I found none of them cruel, and I received
many little kindnesses from them.&nbsp; I discovered that their
trade was largely answerable for the impurity of thought and
speech which so shocked me.&nbsp; Its monotony compelled some
countervailing stimulus, and as they had never been educated to
care for anything in particular, they found the necessary relief
in sensuality.&nbsp; At first they &ldquo;chaffed&rdquo; and
worried me a good deal because of my silence, but at last they
began to think I was &ldquo;religious,&rdquo; and then they
ceased to torment me.&nbsp; I rather encouraged them in the
belief that I had a right to exemption from their conversation,
and I passed, I believe, for a Plymouth brother.&nbsp; The only
thing which they could not comprehend was that I made no attempt
to convert them.</p>
<p>The whole establishment was under the rule of a
deputy-manager, who was the terror of the place.&nbsp; He was
tall, thin, and suffered occasionally from spitting of blood,
brought on no doubt from excitement.&nbsp; He was the strangest
mixture of exactitude and passion.&nbsp; He had complete mastery
over every detail of the business, and he never blundered.&nbsp;
All his work was thorough, down to the very bottom, and he had
the most intolerant hatred of everything which was loose and
inaccurate.&nbsp; He never passed a day without flaming out into
oaths and curses against his subordinates, and they could not say
in his wildest fury that his ravings were beside the mark.&nbsp;
He was wrong in his treatment of men&mdash;utterly
wrong&mdash;but his facts were always correct.&nbsp; I never saw
anybody hated as he was, and the hatred against him was the more
intense because nobody could convict him of a mistake.&nbsp; He
seemed to enjoy a storm, and knew nothing whatever of the
constraints which with ordinary men prevent abusive and brutal
language to those around them.&nbsp; Some of his clerks suffered
greatly from him, and he almost broke down two or three from the
constant nervous strain upon them produced by fear of his
explosions.&nbsp; For my own part, although I came in for a full
share of his temper, I at once made up my mind as soon as I
discovered what he was, not to open my lips to him except under
compulsion.&nbsp; My one object now was to get a living.&nbsp; I
wished also to avoid the self-mortification which must ensue from
altercation.&nbsp; I dreaded, as I have always dreaded beyond
what I can tell, the chaos and wreck which, with me, follows
subjugation by anger, and I held to my resolve under all
provocation.&nbsp; It was very difficult, but how many times I
have blessed myself for adhesion to it.&nbsp; Instead of going
home undone with excitement, and trembling with fear of
dismissal, I have walked out of my dungeon having had to bite my
lips till the blood came, but still conqueror, and with peace of
mind.</p>
<p>Another stratagem of defence which I adopted at the office was
never to betray to a soul anything about myself.&nbsp; Nobody
knew anything about me, whether I was married or single, where I
lived, or what I thought upon a single subject of any
importance.&nbsp; I cut off my office life in this way from my
life at home so completely that I was two selves, and my true
self was not stained by contact with my other self.&nbsp; It was
a comfort to me to think the moment the clock struck seven that
my second self died, and that my first self suffered nothing by
having anything to do with it.&nbsp; I was not the person who sat
at the desk downstairs and endured the abominable talk of his
colleagues and the ignominy of serving such a chief.&nbsp; I knew
nothing about him.&nbsp; I was a citizen walking London streets;
I had my opinions upon human beings and books; I was on equal
terms with my friends; I was Ellen&rsquo;s husband; I was, in
short, a man.&nbsp; By this scrupulous isolation, I preserved
myself, and the clerk was not debarred from the domain of
freedom.</p>
<p>It is very terrible to think that the labour by which men are
to live should be of this order.&nbsp; The ideal of labour is
that it should be something in which we can take an interest and
even a pride.&nbsp; Immense masses of it in London are the merest
slavery, and it is as mechanical as the daily journey of the
omnibus horse.&nbsp; There is no possibility of relieving it, and
all the ordinary copybook advice of moralists and poets as to the
temper in which we should earn our bread is childish
nonsense.&nbsp; If a man is a painter, or a physician, or a
barrister, or even a tradesman, well and good.&nbsp; The maxims
of authors may be of some service to him, and he may be able to
exemplify them; but if he is a copying clerk they are an insult,
and he can do nothing but arch his back to bear his burden and
find some compensation elsewhere.&nbsp; True it is, that
beneficent Nature here, as always, is helpful.&nbsp; Habit, after
a while, mitigated much of the bitterness of destiny.&nbsp; The
hard points of the flint became smoothed and worn away by
perpetual tramping over them, so that they no longer wounded with
their original sharpness; and the sole of the foot was in time
provided with a merciful callosity.&nbsp; Then, too, there was
developed an appetite which was voracious for all that was
best.&nbsp; Who shall tell the revulsion on reaching home, which
I should never have known had I lived a life of idleness!&nbsp;
Ellen was fond of hearing me read, and with a little care I was
able to select what would bear reading&mdash;dramas, for
example.&nbsp; She liked the reading for the reading&rsquo;s
sake, and she liked to know that what I thought was communicated
to her; that she was not excluded from the sphere in which I
lived.&nbsp; Of the office she never heard a word, and I never
would tell her anything about it; but there was scarcely a single
book in my possession which could be read aloud, that we did not
go through together in this way.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t prescribe
this kind of life to everybody.&nbsp; Some of my best friends, I
know, would find it intolerable, but it suited us.&nbsp;
Philosophy and religion I did not touch.&nbsp; It was necessary
to choose themes with varying human interest, such as the best
works of fiction, a play, or a poem; and these perhaps, on the
whole, did me more good at that time than speculation.&nbsp; Oh,
how many times have I left my office humiliated by some silently
endured outbreak on the part of my master, more galling because I
could not put it aside as altogether gratuitous; and in less than
an hour it was two miles away, and I was myself again.&nbsp; If a
man wants to know what the potency of love is, he must be a
menial; he must be despised.&nbsp; Those who are prosperous and
courted cannot understand its power.&nbsp; Let him come home
after he has suffered what is far worse than hatred&mdash;the
contempt of a superior, who knows that he can afford to be
contemptuous, seeing that he can replace his slave at a
moment&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; Let him be trained by his tyrant to
dwell upon the thought that he belongs to the vast crowd of
people in London who are unimportant; almost useless; to whom it
is a charity to offer employment; who are conscious of possessing
no gift which makes them of any value to anybody, and he will
then comprehend the divine efficacy of the affection of that
woman to whom he is dear.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s mercy be praised ever
more for it!&nbsp; I cannot write poetry, but if I could, no
theme would tempt me like that of love to such a person as I
was&mdash;not love, as I say again, to the hero, but love to the
Helot.&nbsp; Over and over again, when I have thought about it, I
have felt my poor heart swell with a kind of uncontrollable
fervour.&nbsp; I have often, too, said to myself that this love
is no delusion.&nbsp; If we were to set it down as nothing more
than a merciful cheat on the part of the Creator, however
pleasant it might be, it would lose its charm.&nbsp; If I were to
think that my wife&rsquo;s devotion to me is nothing more than
the simple expression of a necessity to love somebody, that there
is nothing in me which justifies such devotion, I should be
miserable.&nbsp; Rather, I take it, is the love of woman to man a
revelation of the relationship in which God stands to
him&mdash;of what <i>ought</i> to be, in fact.&nbsp; In the love
of a woman to the man who is of no account God has provided us
with a true testimony of what is in His own heart.&nbsp; I often
felt this when looking at myself and at Ellen.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
is there in me?&rdquo; I have said, &ldquo;is she not the victim
of some self-created deception?&rdquo; and I was wretched till I
considered that in her I saw the Divine Nature itself, and that
her passion was a stream straight from the Highest.&nbsp; The
love of woman is, in other words, a living witness never failing
of an actuality in God which otherwise we should never
know.&nbsp; This led me on to connect it with Christianity; but I
am getting incoherent and must stop.</p>
<p>My employment now was so incessant, for it was still necessary
that I should write for my newspaper&mdash;although my visits to
the House of Commons had perforce ceased&mdash;that I had no time
for any schemes or dreams such as those which had tormented me
when I had more leisure.&nbsp; In one respect this was a
blessing.&nbsp; Destiny now had prescribed for me.&nbsp; I was no
longer agitated by ignorance of what I ought to do.&nbsp; My
present duty was obviously to get my own living, and having got
that, I could do little besides save continue the Sundays with
M&rsquo;Kay.</p>
<p>We were almost entirely alone.&nbsp; We had no means of making
any friends.&nbsp; We had no money, and no gifts of any
kind.&nbsp; We were neither of us witty nor attractive, but I
have often wondered, nevertheless, what it was which prevented us
from obtaining acquaintance with persons who thronged to houses
in which I could see nothing worth a twopenny omnibus fare.&nbsp;
Certain it is, that we went out of our way sometimes to induce
people to call upon us whom we thought we should like; but, if
they came once or twice, they invariably dropped off, and we saw
no more of them.&nbsp; This behaviour was so universal that,
without the least affectation, I acknowledge there must be
something repellent in me, but what it is I cannot tell.&nbsp;
That Ellen was the cause of the general aversion, it is
impossible to believe.&nbsp; The only theory I have is, that
partly owing to a constant sense of fatigue, due to imperfect
health, and partly to chafing irritation at mere gossip, although
I had no power to think of anything better, or say anything
better myself, I was avoided both by the commonplace and those
who had talent.&nbsp; Commonplace persons avoided me because I
did not chatter, and persons of talent because I stood for
nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was nothing in me.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
met at M&rsquo;Kay&rsquo;s two gentlemen whom we thought we might
invite to our house.&nbsp; One of them was an antiquarian.&nbsp;
He had discovered in an excavation in London some Roman
remains.&nbsp; This had led him on to the study of the position
and boundaries of the Roman city.&nbsp; He had become an
authority upon this subject, and had lectured upon it.&nbsp; He
came; but as we were utterly ignorant, and could not, with all
our efforts, manifest any sympathy which he valued at the worth
of a pin, he soon departed, and departed for ever.&nbsp; The
second was a student of Elizabethan literature, and I rashly
concluded at once that he must be most delightful.&nbsp; He
likewise came.&nbsp; I showed him my few poor books, which he
condemned, and I found that such observations as I could make he
considered as mere twaddle.&nbsp; I knew nothing, or next to
nothing, about the editions or the curiosities, or the proposed
emendations of obscure passages, and he, too, departed
abruptly.&nbsp; I began to think after he had gone that my study
of Shakespeare was mere dilettantism but I afterwards came to the
conclusion that if a man wishes to spoil himself for Shakespeare,
the best thing he can do is to turn Shakespearian critic.</p>
<p>My worst enemy at this time was ill health, and it was more
distressing than it otherwise would have been, because I had such
responsibilities upon me.&nbsp; When I lived alone I knew that if
anything should happen to me it would be of no particular
consequence, but now whenever I felt sick I was anxious on
account of Ellen.&nbsp; What would become of her&mdash;this was
the thought which kept me awake night after night when the
terrors of depression were upon me, as they often were.&nbsp; But
still, terrors with growing years had lost their ancient
strength.&nbsp; My brain and nerves were quiet compared with what
they were in times gone by, and I had gradually learned the
blessed lesson which is taught by familiarity with sorrow, that
the greater part of what is dreadful in it lies in the
imagination.&nbsp; The true Gorgon head is seldom seen in
reality.&nbsp; That it exists I do not doubt, but it is not so
commonly visible as we think.&nbsp; Again, as we get older we
find that all life is given us on conditions of uncertainty, and
yet we walk courageously on.&nbsp; The labourer marries and has
children, when there is nothing but his own strength between him
and ruin.&nbsp; A million chances are encountered every day, and
any one of the million accidents which might happen would cripple
him or kill him, and put into the workhouse those who depend upon
him.&nbsp; Yet he treads his path undisturbed.&nbsp; Life to all
of us is a narrow plank placed across a gulf, which yawns on
either side, and if we were perpetually looking down into it we
should fall.&nbsp; So at last, the possibility of disaster ceased
to affright me.&nbsp; I had been brought off safely so many times
when destruction seemed imminent, that I grew hardened, and lay
down quietly at night, although the whim of a madman might
to-morrow cast me on the pavement.&nbsp; Frequently, as I have
said, I could not do this, but I strove to do it, and was able to
do it when in health.</p>
<p>I tried to think about nothing which expressed whatever in the
world may be insoluble or simply tragic.&nbsp; A great change is
just beginning to come over us in this respect.&nbsp; So many
books I find are written which aim merely at new presentation of
the hopeless.&nbsp; The contradictions of fate, the darkness of
death, the fleeting of man over this brief stage of existence,
whence we know not, and whither we know not, are favourite
subjects with writers who seem to think that they are profound,
because they can propose questions which cannot be
answered.&nbsp; There is really more strength of mind required
for resolving the commonest difficulty than is necessary for the
production of poems on these topics.&nbsp; The characteristic of
so much that is said and written now is melancholy; and it is
melancholy, not because of any deeper acquaintance with the
secrets of man than that which was possessed by our forefathers,
but because it is easy to be melancholy, and the time lacks
strength.</p>
<p>As I am now setting down, without much order or connection,
the lessons which I had to learn, I may perhaps be excused if I
add one or two others.&nbsp; I can say of them all, that they are
not book lessons.&nbsp; They have been taught me by my own
experience, and as a rule I have always found that in my own most
special perplexities I got but little help from books or other
persons.&nbsp; I had to find out for myself what was for me the
proper way of dealing with them.</p>
<p>My love for Ellen was great, but I discovered that even such
love as this could not be left to itself.&nbsp; It wanted
perpetual cherishing.&nbsp; The lamp, if it was to burn brightly,
required daily trimming, for people became estranged and
indifferent, not so much by open quarrel or serious difference,
as by the intervention of trifles which need but the smallest,
although continuous effort for their removal.&nbsp; The true
wisdom is to waste no time over them, but to eject them at
once.&nbsp; Love, too, requires that the two persons who love one
another shall constantly present to one another what is best in
them, and to accomplish this, deliberate purpose, and even
struggle, are necessary.&nbsp; If through relapse into idleness
we do not attempt to bring soul and heart into active communion
day by day, what wonder if this once exalted relationship become
vulgar and mean?</p>
<p>I was much overworked.&nbsp; It was not the work itself which
was such a trial, but the time it consumed.&nbsp; At best, I had
but a clear space of an hour, or an hour and a half at home, and
to slave merely for this seemed such a mockery!&nbsp; Day after
day sped swiftly by, made up of nothing but this infernal
drudgery, and I said to myself&mdash;Is this life?&nbsp; But I
made up my mind that <i>never would I give myself
tongue</i>.&nbsp; I clapped a muzzle on my mouth.&nbsp; Had I
followed my own natural bent, I should have become expressive
about what I had to endure, but I found that expression reacts on
him who expresses and intensifies what is expressed.&nbsp; If we
break out into rhetoric over a toothache, the pangs are not the
easier, but the worse to be borne.</p>
<p>I naturally contracted a habit of looking forward from the
present moment to one beyond.&nbsp; The whole week seemed to
exist for the Sunday.&nbsp; On Monday morning I began counting
the hours till Sunday should arrive.&nbsp; The consequence was,
that when it came, it was not enjoyed properly, and I wasted it
in noting the swiftness of its flight.&nbsp; Oh, how absurd is
man!&nbsp; If we were to reckon up all the moments which we
really enjoy for their own sake, how few should we find them to
be!&nbsp; The greatest part, far the greatest part, of our lives
is spent in dreaming over the morrow, and when it comes, it, too,
is consumed in the anticipation of a brighter morrow, and so the
cheat is prolonged, even to the grave.&nbsp; This tendency,
unconquerable though it may appear to be, can to a great extent
at any rate, be overcome by strenuous discipline.&nbsp; I tried
to blind myself to the future, and many and many a time, as I
walked along that dreary New Road or Old St. Pancras Road, have I
striven to compel myself not to look at the image of Hampstead
Heath or Regent&rsquo;s Park, as yet six days in front of me, but
to get what I could out of what was then with me.</p>
<p>The instinct which leads us perpetually to compare what we are
with what we might be is no doubt of enormous value, and is the
spring which prompts all action, but, like every instinct, it is
the source of greatest danger.&nbsp; I remember the day and the
very spot on which it flashed into me, like a sudden burst of the
sun&rsquo;s rays, that I had no right to this or that&mdash;to so
much happiness, or even so much virtue.&nbsp; What title-deeds
could I show for such a right?&nbsp; Straightway it seemed as if
the centre of a whole system of dissatisfaction were removed, and
as if the system collapsed.&nbsp; God, creating from His infinite
resources a whole infinitude of beings, had created me with a
definite position on the scale, and that position only could I
claim.&nbsp; Cease the trick of contrast.&nbsp; If I can by any
means get myself to consider myself alone without reference to
others, discontent will vanish.&nbsp; I walk this Old St. Pancras
Road on foot&mdash;another rides.&nbsp; Keep out of view him who
rides and all persons riding, and I shall not complain that I
tramp in the wet.&nbsp; So also when I think how small and weak I
am.</p>
<p>How foolish it is to try and cure by argument what time will
cure so completely and so gently if left to itself.&nbsp; As I
get older, the anxiety to prove myself right if I quarrel dies
out.&nbsp; I hold my tongue and time vindicates me, if it is
possible to vindicate me, or convicts me if I am wrong.&nbsp;
Many and many a debate too which I have had with myself alone has
been settled in the same way.&nbsp; The question has been put
aside and has lost its importance.&nbsp; The ancient Church
thought, and seriously enough, no doubt, that all the vital
interests of humanity were bound up with the controversies upon
the Divine nature; but the centuries have rolled on, and who
cares for those controversies now.&nbsp; The problems of death
and immortality once upon a time haunted me so that I could
hardly sleep for thinking about them.&nbsp; I cannot tell how,
but so it is, that at the present moment, when I am years nearer
the end, they trouble me but very little.&nbsp; If I could but
bury and let rot things which torment me and come to no
settlement&mdash;if I could always do this&mdash;what a blessing
it would be.</p>

145</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HOLIDAYS</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> said that Ellen had a child
by her first husband.&nbsp; Marie, for that was her name, was now
ten years old.&nbsp; She was like neither her mother nor father,
and yet was <i>shot</i> as it were with strange gleams which
reminded me of her paternal grandmother for a moment, and then
disappeared.&nbsp; She had rather coarse dark hair, small black
eyes, round face, and features somewhat blunt or blurred, the
nose in particular being so.&nbsp; She had a tendency to be
stout.&nbsp; For books she did not care, and it was with the
greatest difficulty we taught her to read.&nbsp; She was not
orderly or careful about her person, and in this respect was a
sore disappointment&mdash;not that she was positively careless,
but she took no pride in dress, nor in keeping her room and her
wardrobe neat.&nbsp; She was fond of bright colours, which was
another trial to Ellen, who disliked any approach to
gaudiness.&nbsp; She was not by any means a fool, and she had a
peculiarly swift mode of expressing herself upon persons and
things.&nbsp; A stranger looking at her would perhaps have
adjudged her inclined to sensuousness, and dull.&nbsp; She was
neither one nor the other.&nbsp; She ate little, although she was
fond of sweets.&nbsp; Her rather heavy face, with no clearly cut
outline in it, was not the typical face for passion; but she was
capable of passion to an extraordinary degree, and what is more
remarkable, it was not explosive passion, or rather it was not
passion which she suffered to explode.&nbsp; I remember once when
she was a little mite she was asked out somewhere to tea.&nbsp;
She was dressed and ready, but it began to rain fast, and she was
told she could not go.&nbsp; She besought, but it was in
vain.&nbsp; We could not afford cabs, and there was no
omnibus.&nbsp; Marie, finding all her entreaties were useless,
quietly walked out of the room; and after some little time her
mother, calling her and finding she did not come, went to look
for her.&nbsp; She had gone into the back-yard, and was sitting
there in the rain by the side of the water-butt.&nbsp; She was
soaked, and her best clothes were spoiled.&nbsp; I must confess
that I did not take very kindly to her.&nbsp; I was irritated at
her slowness in learning; it was, in fact, painful to be obliged
to teach her.&nbsp; I thought that perhaps she might have some
undeveloped taste for music, but she showed none, and our
attempts to get her to sing ordinary melodies were a
failure.&nbsp; She was more or less of a locked cabinet to
me.&nbsp; I tried her with the two or three keys which I had, but
finding that none of them fitted, I took no more pains about
her.</p>
<p>One Sunday we determined upon a holiday.&nbsp; It was a bold
adventure for us, but we had made up our minds.&nbsp; There was
an excursion train to Hastings, and accordingly Ellen, Marie, and
myself were at London Bridge Station early in the morning.&nbsp;
It was a lovely summer&rsquo;s day in mid-July.&nbsp; The journey
down was uncomfortable enough in consequence of the heat and
dust, but we heeded neither one nor the other in the hope of
seeing the sea.&nbsp; We reached Hastings at about eleven
o&rsquo;clock, and strolled westwards towards Bexhill.&nbsp; Our
pleasure was exquisite.&nbsp; Who can tell, save the imprisoned
Londoner, the joy of walking on the clean sea-sand!&nbsp; What a
delight that was, to say nothing of the beauty of the
scenery!&nbsp; To be free of the litter and filth of a London
suburb, of its broken hedges, its brickbats, its torn
advertisements, its worn and trampled grass in fields half given
over to the speculative builder: in place of this, to tread the
immaculate shore over which breathed a wind not charged with
soot; to replace the dull, shrouding obscurity of the smoke by a
distance so distinct that the masts of the ships whose hulls were
buried below the horizon were visible&mdash;all this was perfect
bliss.&nbsp; It was not very poetic bliss, perhaps; but
nevertheless it is a fact that the cleanness of the sea and the
sea air was as attractive to us as any of the sea
attributes.&nbsp; We had a wonderful time.&nbsp; Only in the
country is it possible to note the change of morning into
mid-day, of mid-day into afternoon, and of afternoon into
evening; and it is only in the country, therefore, that a day
seems stretched out into its proper length.&nbsp; We had brought
all our food with us, and sat upon the shore in the shadow of a
piece of the cliff.&nbsp; A row of heavy white clouds lay along
the horizon almost unchangeable and immovable, with their
summit-lines and the part of the mass just below them steeped in
sunlight.&nbsp; The level opaline water differed only from a
floor by a scarcely perceptible heaving motion, which broke into
the faintest of ripples at our feet.&nbsp; So still was the great
ocean, so quietly did everything lie in it, that the wavelets
which licked the beach were as pure and bright as if they were a
part of the mid-ocean depths.&nbsp; About a mile from us, at one
o&rsquo;clock, a long row of porpoises appeared, showing
themselves in graceful curves for half-an-hour or so, till they
went out farther to sea off Fairlight.&nbsp; Some fishing-boats
were becalmed just in front of us.&nbsp; Their shadows slept, or
almost slept, upon the water, a gentle quivering alone showing
that it was not complete sleep, or if sleep, that it was sleep
with dreams.&nbsp; The intensity of the sunlight sharpened the
outlines of every little piece of rock, and of the pebbles, in a
manner which seemed supernatural to us Londoners.&nbsp; In London
we get the heat of the sun, but not his light, and the separation
of individual parts into such vivid isolation was so surprising
that even Marie noticed it, and said it &ldquo;all seemed as if
she were looking through a glass.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
perfect&mdash;perfect in its beauty&mdash;and perfect because,
from the sun in the heavens down to the fly with burnished wings
on the hot rock, there was nothing out of harmony.&nbsp;
Everything breathed one spirit.&nbsp; Marie played near us; Ellen
and I sat still, doing nothing.&nbsp; We wanted nothing, we had
nothing to achieve; there were no curiosities to be seen, there
was no particular place to be reached, no &ldquo;plan of
operations,&rdquo; and London was forgotten for the time.&nbsp;
It lay behind us in the north-west, and the cliff was at the back
of us shutting out all thought of it.&nbsp; No reminiscences and
no anticipations disturbed us; the present was sufficient, and
occupied us totally.</p>
<p>I should like, if I could, to write an essay upon the art of
enjoying a holiday.&nbsp; It is sad to think how few people know
how to enjoy one, although they are so precious.&nbsp; We do not
sufficiently consider that enjoyment of every kind is an art
carefully to be learnt, and specially the art of making the most
of a brief space set apart for pleasure.&nbsp; It is foolish, for
example, if a man, city bred, has but twelve hours before him, to
spend more of it in eating and drinking than is necessary.&nbsp;
Eating and drinking produce stupidity, at least in some degree,
which may just as well be reserved for town.&nbsp; It is foolish
also to load the twelve hours with a task&mdash;so much to be
done.&nbsp; The sick person may perhaps want exercise, but to the
tolerably healthy the best of all recreation is the freedom from
fetters even when they are self-imposed.</p>
<p>Our train homewards was due at Bexhill a little after
seven.&nbsp; By five o&rsquo;clock a change gradual but swift was
observed.&nbsp; The clouds which had charmed us all through the
morning and afternoon were in reality thunder-clouds, which woke
up like a surprised army under perfect discipline, and moved
magnificently towards us.&nbsp; Already afar off we heard the
softened echoing roll of the thunder.&nbsp; Every now and then we
saw a sharp thrust of lightning down into the water, and
shuddered when we thought that perhaps underneath that stab there
might be a ship with living men.&nbsp; The battle at first was at
such a distance that we watched it with intense and solemn
delight.&nbsp; As yet not a breath of air stirred, but presently,
over in the south-east, a dark ruffled patch appeared on the
horizon, and we agreed that it was time to go.&nbsp; The
indistinguishable continuous growl now became articulated into
distinct crashes.&nbsp; I had miscalculated the distance to the
station, and before we got there the rain, skirmishing in
advance, was upon us.&nbsp; We took shelter in a cottage for a
moment in order that Ellen might get a glass of
water&mdash;bad-looking stuff it was, but she was very
thirsty&mdash;and put on her cloak.&nbsp; We then started again
on our way.&nbsp; We reached the station at about half-past six,
before the thunder was overhead, but not before Ellen had got
wet, despite all my efforts to protect her.&nbsp; She was also
very hot from hurrying, and yet there was nothing to be done but
to sit in a kind of covered shed till the train came up.&nbsp;
The thunder and lightning were, however, so tremendous, that we
thought of nothing else.&nbsp; When they were at their worst, the
lightning looked like the upset of a cauldron of white glowing
metal&mdash;with such strength, breadth, and volume did it
descend.&nbsp; Just as the train arrived, the roar began to
abate, and in about half-an-hour it had passed over to the north,
leaving behind the rain, cold and continuous, which fell all
round us from a dark, heavy, grey sky.&nbsp; The carnage in which
we were was a third-class, with seats arranged parallel to the
sides.&nbsp; It was crowded, and we were obliged to sit in the
middle, exposed to the draught which the tobacco smoke made
necessary.&nbsp; Some of the company were noisy, and before we
got to Red Hill became noisier, as the brandy-flasks which had
been well filled at Hastings began to work.&nbsp; Many were
drenched, and this was an excuse for much of the drinking;
although for that matter, any excuse or none is generally
sufficient.&nbsp; At Red Hill we were stopped by other trains,
and before we came to Croydon we were an hour late.&nbsp; We had
now become intolerably weary.&nbsp; The songs were disgusting,
and some of the women who were with the men had also been
drinking, and behaved in a manner which it was not pleasant that
Ellen and Marie should see.&nbsp; The carriage was lighted
fortunately by one dim lamp only which hung in the middle, and I
succeeded at last in getting seats at the further end, where
there was a knot of more decent persons who had huddled up there
away from the others.&nbsp; All the glory of the morning was
forgotten.&nbsp; Instead of three happy, exalted creatures, we
were three dejected, shivering mortals, half poisoned with foul
air and the smell of spirits.&nbsp; We crawled up to London
Bridge at the slowest pace, and, finally, the railway company
discharged us on the platform at ten minutes past eleven.&nbsp;
Not a place in any omnibus could be secured, and we therefore
walked for a mile or so till I saw a cab, which&mdash;unheard-of
expense for me&mdash;I engaged, and we were landed at our own
house exactly at half-past twelve.&nbsp; The first thing to be
done was to get Marie to bed.&nbsp; She was instantly asleep, and
was none the worse for her journey.&nbsp; With Ellen the case was
different.&nbsp; She could not sleep, and the next morning was
feverish.&nbsp; She insisted that it was nothing more than a bad
cold, and would on no account permit me even to give her any
medicine.&nbsp; She would get up presently, and she and Marie
could get on well enough together.&nbsp; But when I reached home
on Monday evening, Ellen was worse, and was still in bed.</p>
<p>I sent at once for the doctor, who would give no opinion for a
day or two, but meanwhile directed that she was to remain where
she was, and take nothing but the lightest food.&nbsp; Tuesday
night passed, and the fever still increased.&nbsp; I had become
very anxious, but I dared not stay with her, for I knew not what
might happen if I were absent from my work.&nbsp; I was obliged
to try and think of somebody who would come and help us.&nbsp;
Our friend Taylor, who once was the coal-porter at Somerset
House, came into my mind.&nbsp; He, as I have said when talking
about him, was married, but had no children.&nbsp; To him
accordingly I went.&nbsp; I never shall forget the alacrity with
which he prompted his wife to go, and with which she
consented.&nbsp; I was shut up in my own sufferings, but I
remember a flash of joy that all our efforts in our room had not
been in vain.&nbsp; I was delighted that I had secured
assistance, but I do believe the uppermost thought was delight
that we had been able to develop gratitude and affection.&nbsp;
Mrs. Taylor was an &ldquo;ordinary woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was
about fifty, rather stout, and entirely uneducated.&nbsp; But
when she took charge at our house, all her best qualities found
expression.&nbsp; It is true enough, <i>omnium consensu capax
imperii nisi imperasset</i>, but it is equally true that under
the pressure of trial and responsibility we are often stronger
than when there is no pressure.&nbsp; Many a man will acknowledge
that in difficulty he has surprised himself by a resource and
coolness which he never suspected before.&nbsp; Mrs. Taylor I
always thought to be rather weak and untrustworthy, but I found
that when <i>weight</i> was placed upon her, she was steady as a
rock, a systematic and a perfect manager.&nbsp; There was no
doubt in a very short time as to the nature of the disease.&nbsp;
It was typhoid fever, the cause probably being the impure water
drunk as we were coming home.&nbsp; I have no mind to describe
what Ellen suffered.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that her treatment
was soon reduced to watching her every minute night and day, and
administering small quantities of milk.&nbsp; Her prostration and
emaciation were excessive, and without the most constant
attention she might at any moment have slipped out of our
hands.&nbsp; I was like a man shipwrecked and alone in a polar
country, whose existence depends upon one spark of fire, which he
tries to cherish, left glimmering in a handful of ashes.&nbsp; Oh
those days, prolonged to weeks, during which that dreadful
struggle lasted&mdash;days swallowed up with one sole, intense,
hungry desire that her life might be spared!&mdash;days filled
with a forecast of the blackness and despair before me if she
should depart.&nbsp; I tried to obtain release from the
office.&nbsp; The answer was that nobody could of course prevent
my being away, but that it was not usual for a clerk to be absent
merely because his wife was not well.&nbsp; The brute added with
a sneer that a wife was &ldquo;a luxury&rdquo; which he should
have thought I could hardly afford.&nbsp; We divided between us,
however, at home the twenty-four hours during which we stood
sentinels against death, and occasionally we were relieved by one
or two friends.&nbsp; I went on duty from about eight in the
evening till one in the morning, and was then relieved by Mrs.
Taylor, who remained till ten or eleven.&nbsp; She then went to
bed, and was replaced by little Marie.&nbsp; What a change came
over that child!&nbsp; I was amazed at her.&nbsp; All at once she
seemed to have found what she was born to do.&nbsp; The key had
been discovered, which unlocked and revealed what there was in
her, of which hitherto I had been altogether unaware.&nbsp;
Although she was so little, she became a perfect nurse.&nbsp; Her
levity disappeared; she was grave as a matron, moved about as if
shod in felt, never forgot a single direction, and gave proper
and womanly answers to strangers who called.&nbsp; Faculties
unsuspected grew almost to full height in a single day.&nbsp;
Never did she relax during the whole of that dreadful time, or
show the slightest sign of discontent.&nbsp; She sat by her
mother&rsquo;s side, intent, vigilant; and she had her little
dinner prepared and taken up into the sickroom by Mrs. Taylor
before she went to bed.&nbsp; I remember once going to her cot in
the night, as she lay asleep, and almost breaking my heart over
her with remorse and thankfulness&mdash;remorse, that I, with
blundering stupidity, had judged her so superficially; and
thankfulness, that it had pleased God to present to me so much of
His own divinest grace.&nbsp; Fool that I was, not to be aware
that messages from Him are not to be read through the envelope in
which they are enclosed.&nbsp; I never should have believed, if
it had not been for Marie, that any grown-up man could so love a
child.&nbsp; Such love, I should have said, was only possible
between man and woman, or, perhaps, between man and man.&nbsp;
But now I doubt whether a love of that particular kind could be
felt towards any grown-up human being, love so pure, so
imperious, so awful.&nbsp; My love to Marie was love of God
Himself as He is&mdash;an unrestrained adoration of an efflux
from Him, adoration transfigured into love, because the
revelation had clothed itself with a child&rsquo;s form.&nbsp; It
was, as I say, the love of God as He is.&nbsp; It was not
necessary, as it so often is necessary, to qualify, to subtract,
to consider the other side, to deplore the obscurity or the
earthly contamination with which the Word is delivered to
us.&nbsp; This was the Word itself, without even consciousness on
the part of the instrument selected for its vocalisation.&nbsp; I
may appear extravagant, but I can only put down what I felt and
still feel.&nbsp; I appeal, moreover, to Jesus Himself for
justification.&nbsp; I had seen the kingdom of God through a
little child.&nbsp; I, in fact, have done nothing more than beat
out over a page in my own words what passed through His mind when
He called a little child and set him in the midst of His
disciples.&nbsp; How I see the meaning of those words now! and so
it is that a text will be with us for half a lifetime, recognised
as great and good, but not penetrated till the experience comes
round to us in which it was born.</p>
<p>Six weeks passed before the faint blue point of light which
flickered on the wick began to turn white and show some
strength.&nbsp; At last, however, day by day, we marked a slight
accession of vitality which increased with change of diet.&nbsp;
Every evening when I came home I was gladdened by the tidings
which showed advance, and Ellen, I believe, was as much pleased
to see how others rejoiced over her recovery as she was pleased
for her own sake.&nbsp; She, too, was one of those creatures who
always generously admit improvement.&nbsp; For my own part, I
have often noticed that when I have been ill, and have been
getting better, I have refused to acknowledge it, and that it has
been an effort to me to say that things were not at their
worst.&nbsp; She, however, had none of this niggardly baseness,
and always, if only for the sake of her friends, took the
cheerful side.&nbsp; Mrs. Taylor now left us.&nbsp; She left us a
friend whose friendship will last, I hope, as long as life
lasts.&nbsp; She had seen all our troubles and our poverty: we
knew that she knew all about us: she had helped us with the most
precious help&mdash;what more was there necessary to knit her to
us?&mdash;and it is worth noting that the assistance which she
rendered, and her noble self-sacrifice, so far from putting us,
in her opinion, in her debt, only seemed to her a reason why she
should be more deeply attached to us.</p>
<p>It was late in the autumn before Ellen had thoroughly
recovered, but at last we said that she was as strong as she was
before, and we determined to celebrate our deliverance by one
more holiday before the cold weather came.&nbsp; It was again
Sunday&mdash;a perfectly still, warm, autumnal day, with a high
barometer and the gentlest of airs from the west.&nbsp; The
morning in London was foggy, so much so that we doubted at first
whether we should go; but my long experience of London fog told
me that we should escape from it with that wind if we got to the
chalk downs away out by Letherhead and Guildford.&nbsp; We took
the early train to a point at the base of the hills, and wound
our way up into the woods at the top.&nbsp; We were beyond the
smoke, which rested like a low black cloud over the city in the
north-east, reaching a third of the way up to the zenith.&nbsp;
The beech had changed colour, and glowed with reddish-brown
fire.&nbsp; We sat down on a floor made of the leaves of last
year.&nbsp; At mid-day the stillness was profound, broken only by
the softest of whispers descending from the great trees which
spread over us their protecting arms.&nbsp; Every now and then it
died down almost to nothing, and then slowly swelled and died
again, as if the Gods of the place were engaged in divine and
harmonious talk.&nbsp; By moving a little towards the external
edge of our canopy we beheld the plain all spread out before us,
bounded by the heights of Sussex and Hampshire.&nbsp; It was
veiled with the most tender blue, and above it was spread a sky
which was white on the horizon and deepened by degrees into azure
over our heads.&nbsp; The exhilaration of the air satisfied
Marie, although she had no playmate, and there was nothing
special with which she could amuse herself.&nbsp; She wandered
about looking for flowers and ferns, and was content.&nbsp; We
were all completely happy.&nbsp; We strained our eyes to see the
furthest point before us, and we tried to find it on the map we
had brought with us.&nbsp; The season of the year, which is
usually supposed to make men pensive, had no such effect upon
us.&nbsp; Everything in the future, even the winter in London,
was painted by Hope, and the death of the summer brought no
sadness.&nbsp; Rather did summer dying in such fashion fill our
hearts with repose, and even more than repose&mdash;with actual
joy.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Here ends the autobiography.&nbsp; A month after this last
holiday my friend was dead and buried.&nbsp; He had unsuspected
disease of the heart, and one day his master, of whom we have
heard something, was more than usually violent.&nbsp; Mark, as
his custom was, was silent, but evidently greatly excited.&nbsp;
His tyrant left the room; and in a few minutes afterwards Mark
was seen to turn white and fall forward in his chair.&nbsp; It
was all over!&nbsp; His body was taken to a hospital and thence
sent home.&nbsp; The next morning his salary up to the day of his
death came in an envelope to his widow, without a single word
from his employers save a request for acknowledgment.&nbsp;
Towards mid-day, his office coat, and a book found in his drawer,
arrived in a brown paper parcel, carriage unpaid.</p>
<p>On looking over his papers, I found the sketch of his life and
a mass of odds and ends, some apparently written for
publication.&nbsp; Many of these had evidently been in envelopes,
and had most likely, therefore, been offered to editors or
publishers, but all, I am sure, had been refused.&nbsp; I add one
or two by way of appendix, and hope they will be thought worth
saving.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
